            The Internet Computer community is considering two proposals aimed at refining the networkâ€™s tokenomics. These initiatives strive to align with ongoing efforts to enhance network performance and capabilities.

Proposal Updates and Community Engagement:

It's important to note that there has been an update to the initial proposals following community discussions on the forum. The first proposal originally suggested converting 8-year neuron dissolve delays to 5 years but was revised to apply only to future settings. Existing neurons will retain their terms unless the owner opts for a change.

Proposal 1: Modifying Neuron Dissolve Delays

The proposal aims to reduce neuron dissolve delays by approximately 37.5%, maintaining the age property of neurons, which influences their voting power. This adjustment would not change the current mechanics significantly but aims to decrease the rate of new maturity gained by neurons by about 20%. This adjustment is seen as a way to decrease inflation from governance staking without negating past commitments to stakeholders.

Proposal 2: Conversion of Locked ICP Maturity for Increased Liquidity

This proposal allows neuron owners to convert their locked ICP maturity into unstaked ICP, potentially enhancing liquidity and utility. This could facilitate the use of ICP in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or improve tax implications for the owners by shifting from income to capital gains taxation, which could be more favorable in certain jurisdictions.

Community Response and Next Steps:

The community response has been actively engaged, with detailed discussions about the implications and benefits of these changes. Official forum proposals will be drafted to reflect these updates and provide a platform for further discussion.

Conclusion:

These proposals represent thoughtful considerations to improve the economic foundation of the Internet Computer network, emphasizing community involvement and gradual adaptation.
