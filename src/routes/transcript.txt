00:00:00	[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] ICP is an innovation beyond what is possible for what we thought of the internet the reason why I love ICP is because of its amazing community and we know for sure that we're going to the moon the world's first decentralized web services blockchain we're essentially trying to create a new internet decentralized and open for everybody ICP smart contracts can secure assets on any network KY technology is awesome and the onchain governance that IP is doing is

00:01:43	great the community found this amazing technology and we care so much about it we're so passionate about it so we're almost the aliens bunch of freaks have come over worked on the same platform and built some of the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life using ICP is just like deploying to the cloud it's out of this world Mark contra literally control Smart contracts from all other [Music] chains ICP whoop whoop as I'm sure many of you have heard however today we're going to be discussing a different ICP

00:02:17	called the internet computer protocol created by definity Foundation led by Chief scientist Dominic Williams chugachuga today I'm your host Kyle stofflet and we are gathered here today to celebrate the internet computer second annual ICP Community Conference we have over 9 hours of broadcasting content with over 20 with 23 meetups around the world we also have about $100,000 in airdrops that you will be able to redeem in this broadcast so look out for codes that will pop up on screen you'll see an airdrop alert and with

00:02:50	those you'll get like a green notification that you will qualify for the airdrop uh they could be coming up very fast so make sure you are all paying attention and make make sure you're also using the hash ipcc 2024 whenever posting on socials now I'd like to take the moment to thank our main organizers of the event Coden state which we have estabon and Ben with us and then the swap team who have all made this possible and also I'd like to take the time to thank our sponsors who have also contributed to the success of

00:03:23	pcpcc so first we have omnity bitfinity icx dmail CL geek Factory Nuance bionic Elna locom mining open chat X Dragon Vault bet ICP swap catalyze Cyclops Cosmic wraps and Orly and now to thank our Media Partners for also contributing to everyone seeing this broadcast around the world so first I'd like to thank coin Telegraph then crypto slate blockchain pill and be in crypto and of course the swap team so make sure you are sharing this post all over commenting this is the time to get super excited for the event so now I'd

00:04:09	like to also thank Bas giant for contributing to all the editing of the footage you're about to see so let's go over to lamesh Duda from definity Foundation hello everyone welcome to ipcc I'm lomes data I'm the vice president of growth here at the definity foundation uh definity uh is a major contributor to the internet computer blockchain our foundation is comprised of about 270 people uh majority of them cryptographers and researchers and uh we have been working on this protocol for five plus years so definity was started

00:04:50	by our founder Dominic Williams who comes from the early ethereum Community he had this idea of um this world computer when he heard the term I believe vitalik mentioned that and and earlier so uh he's like oh what is this world computer how do we go about kind of building this together these words to him meant was like how can we build a system which can run any form of software that like mankind runs today how can it be run redone in a on a on a blockchain fast forward 2017 we raised about $160 million from the likes of in

00:05:23	recent horz poly chain did an Ico and started amassing this uh Team of um um engineers and yeah we launch our mnet in 2021 uh we have thousands of like entrepreneurs and developers that are building amazing stuff yeah so we welcome you to the internet computer uh protocol ecosystem and uh really look forward uh for um like yeah helping you bring on board [Music] I told you those aird drops were going to be coming up quick I hope you caught that one uh great to hear from lsh as always he's SE certainly goated um now

00:06:14	we'd like to take a moment to educate you all about internet computer protocol so web 3 is the future but it's still much harder to use than web 2 the industry is fragmented across many blockchains forcing web3 Builders to choose between difficult compromises in centralization versus usability these compromises were only necessary because web 3 was incomplete in May 2021 this all changed with the launch of the internet computer protocol or ICP ICP is a decentralized cloud that Bridges the gap between web 2 and web 3

00:06:51	to create ICP over 100 cryptographers worked for eight years to perfect an utterly new cryptography innovation it's called chainkey technology but before we explain how it works let's quickly look at the incredible things ICP can do first let's explore how decentralized applications on ICP can pair with web 2 applications ICP has a powerful new type of smart contract called canisters they are decentralized web servers that can directly host full websites with low latency canisters can store up to four

00:07:30	400 GB of data perform complex calculations and connect to web2 services and apis without oracles users don't pay gas on ICP when canisters do computations they burn a token called Cycles from a built-in wallet this process is called a reverse gas model gas costs on ICP usually get paid by the core teams or Dows that own the canisters but some daps collect assets to cover their gas costs themselves the Cycles needed to run canisters can only be minted by burning ICP tokens and the mint ratio gets stabilized against the

00:08:10	real world costs of running the physical nodes that are doing the computation the cost of Hosting daps on ICP is consistent and inexpensive regardless of whether the price of ICP tokens goes up or down the result is that canisters can deliver decentralized web experiences that look look and feel indistinguishable from web 2 next let's look into how ICP connects with the web 3 world most web 3 blockchains require Bridges to connect to other chains bridges are built by deploying smart contracts on each chain and relaying

00:08:47	transactions between them relaying transactions across chains often involves expensive cryptography computation multisig wallets between trusted parties and offchain Oracle the complicated architecture of web 3 Bridges makes them slow costly difficult to use and prone to security Brides ICP canisters can directly sign transactions on other blockchains such as Bitcoin and ethereum without Bridges or centralized service providers canisters can mint ordinals on bitcoin deploy smart contracts on ethereum and do anything a

00:09:25	human user can do across different web 3 blockchains effectively making them decentralized autonomous web 3 users the result is that ICP can abstract away the complexity of multi-chain transactions so that users can enjoy a seamless web 3 experience chain key technology the alien Tech powering IP makes these incredible capabilities possible to understand chain key let's review how typical web 3 secret Keys work when a web 3 user wants to create a new blockchain transaction they sign a message to the blockchain using a secret

00:10:02	key that only they know a threshold signature is when one secret key gets broken up into pieces held by different nodes in a network together these nodes can collectively sign messages without ever revealing the entire secret key to any node in the network governments and militaries have been using threshold cryptography to protect their most valuable Secrets since the 9s however these organizations only execute threshold signatures within controlled private networks blockchain networks must be public trustless and

00:10:38	decentralized web 3 nodes might be offline or malicious and an attacker might even try to collect the pieces of the secret key over time secure threshold signatures on web 3 were impossible until the definity foundation invented chain key technology with chain key up to onethird of nodes could be offline or delicious and the network can still generate a secure signature the pieces of the secret key stored on each node are also constantly scrambling so that any information leaked from a node is useless to attackers this makes it

00:11:14	possible to create a decentralized network that can use secret Keys No human or computer will ever know definity built ICP on top of chain key technology to completely reimagine what an L1 blockchain could be with the vision of creating a fully decentralized internet for example anyone can verify the content received from the internet computer by simply validating a signature without syncing the entire blockchain in addition 0% of ICP nodes run on AWS or other big Tech Cloud providers ICP nodes are themselves

00:11:51	independent private clouds running in data centers all over the world furthermore nodes on ICP only act as vendors for an onchain da that manages an ICP Network called the network nervous system or nns ICP holders who stake tokens in the nns are the only ones who can control the source code of the network and they can collectively update the network without hard Forks ICP is entirely alien to anything else within web 2 or web 3 which makes it perfect for connecting the two in ways never possible before with Bitcoin

00:12:28	Humanity got the first essential calized network with ethereum Humanity got the first decentralized logic with ICP Humanity now has the first decentralized secret Keys the first decentralized cloud and the first decentralized AI models oh yeah did we mention that ICP is the only blockchain that can fully host AI models on chain now that is alien Tech the future of the internet belongs to everyone and it won't be harder to use whatever blockchains you love and whatever web 3 future you're fighting for icp's alien Tech will be a

00:13:04	part of it explore what ICP has to offer and take your place in the web 3 Invasion and now that you've learned the basics on internet computer protocol we're going to show you two ways ICP interacts with other blockchains such as ethereum and salana so welcome welcome to orally the future of decentralized data feeding and automation Ori is a fully decentralized cross-chain Oracle Factory built on top of ICP blockchain that offers a cost effective and easy to integrate solutions for businesses of all sizes

00:13:45	decentralized data fetching makes the data provided by our oracles trustworthy you can access real world data in a secure and reliable way orali makes it easy to subscribe to oracles for data feeding or automation purposes with our platform working on different chains making it the ultimate solution for your decentralized applications if you don't find a suitable Oracle for your data feeding you can create a new one that suits your needs and share it with others in our platform orali is a perfect solution for developers and

00:14:17	businesses looking for a coste effective fully decentralized and userfriendly platform to access real world data and automat smart contract actions join our demo waight list today and discover how orally can re evolutionize the way you access and use real world data in your decentralized [Music] applications first of all I'm happy to be part of this conversation and I want to say hello to everyone from the IP Community my name is Tito and basically I have a blockchain development and consulting company I work with my

00:14:56	co-founder CI we are doing this for the last five five six years we really enjoy the the blockchain space been building different stuffs on different protocols but found at ICP this year and we enjoy the technology it's super awesome we believe that the most important asset of every chain is their community and the contributors that are building their own Solutions their own Alternatives Galactic Bridges it's a moood chain protocol that allow you to move assets from one chain to another you can

00:15:26	connect your plug wallet or some other kind of web extent and you can also connect your Phantom wallet it starts with saana but I think that we can expand to other chains as well the protocol is flexible enough and Universal enough that can bring many other chains so soan is maybe only the first so our main goal is to make it user friendly and super easy for even non crypto natives I think that in the future ICP will become a hub for multichain communication swaps and tokens so I think that infrastructure

00:15:56	pieces like Galactic Bridge CK BTC CK and other similar projects will be driving force back in the days we were building another cross chain protocol that was connecting Bitcoin eth and other chains and it was insanely hard we have to develop smart contracts on every separate chain but with ICP one of the most impressive things in my opinion is this chank key cryptography and the threshold ecdsa my point is that on IP you can natively make the cross chain communication super smoothly super descent calized the most Advanced

00:16:31	Technologies that I haven't seen on any other blockchain especially on layer one we are building Galactic Bridge because it's alternative to the native chain key integration basically with our approach we can support any kind of chain without waiting for a new integration to be done on ICP and support a new signature it's just an alternative to what the definity foundation is doing and I believe that the more Alternatives you have and the more decentralized solutions and more solutions the system have the

00:17:04	[Music] better you've seen how the internet computer is interoperable how about we show you some of the exciting projects building in our ecosystem and before that make sure you are using the hashtag ipcc 2024 and spreading this all over socials let's get that awareness going open chat is a decentralized chat app governed by the people for the people our vision is to become the world's leading chat platform with a feature set in performance on a par with Discord and slack plus crypto native features and

00:17:38	tokenization and provable levels of security and privacy sign in without a password using internet identity and soon with many other providers including Google and metamask chats are organized into direct chats which are private and groups communities and channels which can be public or private [Music] groups and communities can be gated by many different criteria including payment Gates which allow owners to monetize their [Music] communities messages can be replied to in line or in threaded [Music]

00:18:16	view chats can play host to multi-person video calls with screen sharing and soon broadcast faces with thousands of viewers and listeners each user has their own wallet and can send chat messages coning crypto such as ckpc or ICP tokens can be swapped for exchanges or over-the counter by making swap offers in [Music] chats users can tip messages and send prize messages for other users to [Music] claim open chat is a dow governed and evolved by the people who use it and invest in it the Dow has a treasury of

00:18:57	ICP and its native token that it uses to find development and growth the treasury can only be accessed by Dow proposal and likewise the Open chat software itself can only be upgraded by proposal users can take part in the governance of open chat and many other dials from the app itself they can view and discuss proposals vote on proposals and even make new proposals open chat has around 2 and a 12,000 daily active users and 12,000 monthly active users since launch the primary focus of the core team has been

00:19:30	to build the Open chat dap we are now entering a marketing and growth phase where we will actively seek to attract communities and users from across the crypto space and [Music] Beyond bionic is an ordinal Market place and Launchpad that we've been building on the internet computer protocol nfts on bitcoin have been all the rage they've done over two billion dollars in volume over the last 12 months and we're seeing people actually starting to build on bitcoin again and we've you know taken the advantage of the Integrations

00:20:16	you know tcdsa subnet ability to read and write directly to bitcoin the cbtc token on on ICP we built bionic as an ordinal Marketplace leveraging all of that Tech so you can trade ordinals at the speed and cost of ICP rather than the speed and cost of bitcoin along with that we have all the other advantages of being built on a Bitcoin side chain fast transactions no gas fees or network fees for users really easy onboard experience and a lot of flexible tooling for creators and collectors ipx is a decentralized

00:20:51	exchange built entirely on the chain based on the IC protocol aiming to become a decentralized financial hub web 3 burning fresh features and solutions to IC defi seam ipx is powered by the pmm algorithm which offers a more precise price Discovery and liquidity management over the am models additionally it's propri to a Smart voting algorithm enables users trade optimal ratios across various pools creating IC rc-2 or dm20 tokens on icps is straightforward and requires no coding users can also customize

00:21:20	deflationary attributes of their tokens ipx supports public private and anchored pools and allows users to provide liquidity addressing diverse need like y farming fundraising and Market making if you're interested in building defi on IC or launching a project on IC swiftly please visit icp.org I'm Tom I'm the person behind cycle let me provide a quick overview about the project cycle is a community registry of projects that are related to the internet computer currently there are more than 400 projects on this website

00:21:59	site if you are looking for a particular category you can filter by the category cycle is on its way to transition into a dow anyone who would like to list a project will be able to do [Music] so Nuance is a long form publishing platform that is governed by the reading and writing Community sure we have cool features like nft gated premium content articles uh that can only be accessed if you have a particular nft in your wallet it's a cryptographically secure pay wall with a fixed Supply but we think the real

00:22:46	differentiator is that writers and readers can govern the platform upon which they contribute content Nuance achieves this by leveraging the internet computers SNS Nuance is a decentralized autonomous organization governed by the users via tokens newer token holders govern the platform the incentives of writers readers and developers are align although Nuance is only just getting started the community of writers readers and developers is building some kiar software [Music] I hope you caught those airdrops make

00:23:35	sure you're typing in those codes so you can stay active uh it was also great to hear from all those amazing projects in our very first showcase and now I'd love to discuss the pcpcc a proposal recently went live in the network nervous system for the pcpcc da which had majority support from the ICP ecosystem and now we're going to hear from joam Hartman and he's going to explain this D's purpose to you right [Music] now hi everyone this is Johan speaking today we'll be covering a few important terms uh in regards to DS on the

00:24:22	internet computer protocol the first term we'll be looking at is the nns so what is the nns it is actually the Dow that runs the internet computer protocol Network it's also the only way to update the source code of the protocol and it's actually extremely interesting because it puts the token holders in charge over node providers or even core developers a second an interesting term are neurons so what are neurons once you have your tokens you can stake them in neurons which will grant you governing rights

00:24:50	you can also follow other neurons for voting which is extremely uh interesting in terms of liquid democracy the last term I would like to go through is uh the SNS so what's an SNS it is a dowo created on a Lun pad which is on the nns it has gasless decentralized front end it gives the availability for the to have a fully Unchained treasury with no custodians as a user it becomes extremely interesting because you can own and manage tabs let's move on to the IC PCC so what is the IC PCC Dao LLC you

00:25:22	first have to know that the ICPC is the first and largest event Series in the ICP ecosystem right now it's is uh being launched as a SNS Dow hopefully it will become a community-owned and fully self-sustaining decentralized conference event series devoted to highlighting the icp's technology and ecosystem what will this Dow do exactly going into 2025 the ICPC da will host two type of events per year we will host a multi-day conference like the one last year in 2023 as well a global live stream like this year's

00:25:54	event it is also key to know that all tickets VIP perks and merch will be collected Ed in the native token and go straight back to the Dow treasury along with all the proceeds from event sponsorships so how will this work exactly right now the ICBC event is being launched into a SNS Dow with three specific components the first one to know is that the Dow will be registered as a martial Islands dowo NLC which uh provides the Dao members liability protection it also gives the Dao corporate personhood so it can sign

00:26:24	agreements on intellectual property or even hire employees which is extremely important the da will also have a council called the iccc council members will have no power to act on behalf of the da but they are simply community members that were selected by the da to submit quality proposals for it to vote on council members are selected or fired and they are accountable to the Dao with protection to prevent them controlling too much influence over uh the voting power the general voting power and the

00:26:55	final aspect which is a key document is the DA's ICBC Constitution it is ratified as an official uh governing document it is on chain gives the Dow specific processes for handling certain tasks such as hiring for example which um is extremely important how can you help now well if you believe in the decentralized future where communities can manage events I would totally suggest you to have a look at launch. ip- cc.com [Music] great to hear from joam uh about the pcpcc SNS Dow and now I'd like to take a

00:27:40	brief moment to thank everyone who's been gathering with us around the world and tuning in live for this broadcast so again make sure you are tuning in to the stream commenting getting some memes out watching for those airdrops and you know sharing the link so we do have meetups 23 meetups across the world and and some of those are uh Berlin which I believe Coden State's at and Austin which also has Coden State team members um and then we also have New York La Miami Milwaukee with the broadcast and Sri Lanka um and

00:28:12	many others going on across the world so uh let's show our support get that hashtag going with ipcc 2024 keep the tweets coming in and you know community members that reach out and tag me with some of these memes maybe I'll give out an additional airdrop I know MCO Sentinels just came out so uh the best meme I will give out a MCO Sentinel sometime after the conference but now uh I'd like to say uh we are going to go into a MCO boot camp testimonial from some of our graduates so tune in hi guys my name is Lucas and I'm one

00:28:51	of the finalist of the first edition of the Moto C and I think it was about 2 years ago and I still remember the excitement that we all found that we are doing something new and cool together so Moto C helped me to get started into internet computer ecosystem and I stayed active ever since worked on multiple bounties and projects such as bitshop which is like Online Marketplace where you can shop and buy things that Bitcoin then we participated in the Bitcoin Olympics Eaton where we won the main

00:29:23	prize with our project Noster which is a Noster client running on the internet computer so I would like to encourage everyone that is considering building in the internet computer to join motoc boot camp because it really helps me and I think it can help you as well especially if you are new to blockchain development so thanks to se for doing this and good luck to your projects and hope to see you in person soon bye [Music] hi my name is Ellie I've been in the ICP ecosystem almost since Genesis with the

00:30:10	first nfts and when I learned about the first motoco boot camp I did not have any programming experience so it was very hard and intense week for it but at the end I knew I wanted to build on the IC and here I am with an app that I have built with a friend it's called overseen it's a social Dow generator that create Dows in the form of what we call Society where you have an avatar that level up reflecting your involvement in your group in your community and when there is a proposal you have more or less

00:30:48	voting power depending on your experience you have also achievement and with this platform you can create you can participate in new uh in other societies so if you are curious about the ICP or about the motoco boot camp I highly recommend you to start your journey on the IC here Seb is an excellent teacher and you will not regret it it's very powerful [Music] experience and it was great to hear those testimonials for the M Mako boot camp graduates and now we're going to go hear from Sebastian who started up these

00:31:31	programs for the Mako boot camp so oh hey hello everyone yes I am interrupting the live stream from my room I have an important invitation to share with all of you but before that we are celebrating the third anniversary of the internet computer and during those three years there is a question that I've been asked so many times why the internet computer over any other ecosystem for me everything started 3 years ago when I was learning Moto and decided to drop out of school the same year then two years ago I started

00:32:10	teaching Moto and together with other people we run the first edition of moto boot camp and it was pretty cool then one year ago around the same time as the first ICP Community Conference other people started to run their own edition of moto boot camp around the world and it was also pretty cool Beyond any price pitch or feature there is something that resonated with all of the students that have ever met a vision today I want to talk about this vision and today I also want to tell you how we are going to make it

00:32:44	real so what is this Vision Moto boot camp is not just about teaching Moto the programming language it's about transmitting Moto the spirit have you ever wondered what Moto means in Japanese Moto means from Foundation I choose the internet computer because the blockchain revolution is not about putting a old system on the chain it's about rebuilding a new one it's about rebuilding New Foundations today I am officially graduating from Coden State thanks guys for your amazing support and today I am announcing the next chapter

00:33:17	of moto boot camp we are building a school together I believe Dows are the ups for the next Industrial Revolution I believe Dows will Empower communities and individuals across the globe I believe Dows will unlock a new wave of Innovations like never seen before imagine a school for entrepreneurs that share the same Vision Imaging a school to master the power of the internet computer this summer I will be building the foundation for this school in public with all of you doesn't matter if you are a builder an investor a Community

00:33:49	member or just curious you are all welcome to join us welcome to the open internet summer [Music] [Music] and hope you caught that airdrop it's for alien token which is a new token launching on ICP uh led by sne da and 45% of this allocation will be given out today so make sure you're checking the airdrops and getting those codes in because it's really important if you want this one um the rest is you know not being taken by a team allocation by any means um and I just want to give a thanks to Sebastian who you know created

00:34:45	so much uh with the MCO boot camp and his announcement was phenomenal uh last year got to share a meal with him at the pcpcc 2023 so shout out to Sebastian you're awesome really appreciate the work you're putting in especially with this Galactic airdrop app that you built um I also want to take the time to uh thank everyone for joining us this far into the broadcast we have a lot of content that's going to be coming and a really special one from uh six figs also Kyle love the name uh he's got his

00:35:16	documentary about cracking FTX and we're also going to be hearing from a lot of influencers around the ecosystem and a lot more projects as well uh so make sure you're tagging them and getting the hash ipcc 2020 before out there sharing some memes spreading the good word and you know we'll have U more of our sponsors coming up here soon um so make sure you're tuned in and sharing the screen the stream thank you what if monitoring web 3 applications was easier than the Legacy web2 cloudstack what if

00:35:47	it was so easy that you didn't need to write a single line of code and it took less than 10 minutes to set up that's Cyclops proactive automated no code canister management for the internet computer running 100% on chain with zero downtime for over a year Cyclops monitors over 350 canister applications from nfid to Yumi funded discover and [Music] more the IC blockchain has a reverse gas model where developers pay for the canisters running their applications in Cycles if a canister gets low on Cycles

00:36:18	it can make the application unresponsive or even worse if a canister runs out of Cycles the application is deleted Cyclops thaws out your Cycles worries by providing Pro active canister cycles topups and comes with a complete web free monitoring Suite built on top of the latest IC devops features to keep your applications running and keep you focused on developing great products to learn more about the future of web 3 devops head over to Cyclops dodev and follow us at Cyclops on x for upcoming [Music]

00:36:54	releases hey everybody Jordan lass from De Merchant Labs today I'd like to talk talk to you a little bit about what it's like to build on ICP applications on the internet computer are known as canisters basically a canister is a web assembly module that's really nice because we can compile many many languages into waso in practice we have rust we have a language called Matco created by the definity foundation specifically for the internet computer thanks to my company diversion Labs we have typescript and JavaScript

00:37:21	and python there's also a project doing C++ and in the future everything is going to be running on on ass simply eventually DFX are the command line tools provided to us by the definity foundation DFX is going to allow you to spin up local nodes or replicas compile all of your canister source code into wasm and test it locally and even deploy to mainten it once you have DFX installed if you are TPT or a JavaScript developer you're going to need node that's your that's your main dependency the whole point here it is just a web

00:37:50	application like that's the whole goal that's whole Vision it's going to be a web application instead of deploying to a centralized Cloud platform you deploy it to a decentralized Cloud platform we have Express working we're going to have postgress working soon the goal is to just get all these npm packages to work so that this is your normal Dev environment and once you have that you can deploy locally you can deploy to main net what's really really nice about the internet computer and a vision that

00:38:14	I'm pushing for this you write your code and you deploy scaling security failovers rate limiting all that kind of crazy stuff is abstracted away as much as possible so that as a developer you just focus on building build your logic I'd like to describe it like this basically the internet computer has 1,000 times the computational resources of these other chains the smart contract size they're generally in the kilobytes for example ethereum it's a megahertz processor that all apps have to share at

00:38:42	that core layer on the internet computer you have a gahz processor per application one of the core benefits of the internet computer is ownership canisters can be controlled by no one and essentially become autonomous or they can be controlled by a group something like a dow a decentralized autonomous or organization this is something that is difficult to achieve on a centralized Cloud platform you'd have to create a protocol kind of similar to the internet computer this is very cool because it allows you to

00:39:06	create for example an autonomous internet service like an API that's running no one owns her controls and as long as people pay for it it can just run itself personally as a developer I've felt it's it's weird and difficult I always have to find an API that's always owned by one entity or company or individual I I never actually own that thing and I don't have any guarantee that it's is going to keep running so that's something very interesting that the internet computer allows you to do controllers on a canister are the key

00:39:33	pairs that control it if you remove all of them your canister becomes autonomous if you set the canister as its own controller or you set the controller to another canister for example then you can start to create these kind of Dow or decentralized group ownerships look if you believe in the ethos of web 3 if you believe that decentralized computation actually has the capability of blessing the world we need your help it's not going to just get built the internet computer like we talked about provides a

00:39:59	thousand times more computational resources than other networks bring your typescript skills bring your JavaScript skills bring your python skills build decentralized AI if these things have value you need to show the world that it has that value you need to help us discover the use cases that are going to succeed [Music] another airdrop right there whoop whoop great to hear from Jordan last as always he's an outstanding builder in this ecosystem and now we're going to hear from another developer in the ecosystem

00:40:48	for gaming and airdrops this is going to be Tommy from boom Dow hi I'm Enzo hey I'm Leo with you exin Foundation Engineers I've worked on CK BTC and CK ethereum we both resigned from the foundation to build the first stable coin on the IC it's a Bitcoin backed stable coin fully decentralized with three unique features you can St your Bitcoin to ear yields you can transfer to earn it's fully decentralized and imitable if you want to know more you can follow us on X at tyor have a wonderful conference

00:41:19	everyone see [Music] you hello I PCC I'm Tommy I'm the co-founder of Boom Dow I'll kind of give you guys an overview of Boom Dow and then talk a little bit about what we're doing so boom is a DA for all ICP games we're really focused on bringing the use case of fully on trained games to the ICP ecosystem you'll see in many other game ecosystems you know they put tokens or nfts in their game but on ICP you can take it to a whole another level where you can have all your game logic and game database completely on chain so

00:41:55	that's something that boom Dow is really passionate about because by putting everything of a game on chain it allows very new features that emerge that have never been possible before such as composability between games things like sharing data between games and so we're really excited about some of the features that will be coming out soon and something that I'm really excited to talk about is the gaming guilds which is now live on the Boom Out platform and something that we've been working really

00:42:19	hard towards the last few months we have a few different games that have integrated the boom Dow infrastructure in order to to integrate with the gaming guilds and it's a really cool way to get many many new Gamers into the ICP ecosystem as well as reward them with really cool tokens and and onchain rewards and create this kind of flywheel effect where we can have Gamers referring other Gamers to other ICP games within the the boom Dow ecosystem boom Dow is really just here to help the gaming vertical on the IC work together

00:42:49	with all the games on the IC that grow together make ICP the the gaming destination for web 3 building a fully onchain game is a very very complicated task it's already super super hard to build a regular game it takes you know sometimes two to three years even to build a AAA game so it's a very long process to build a game and then you add blockchain elements to that and it becomes like near impossible and that's why we've seen a lot of game developers kind of put the blockchain to the side and just kind of build a game

00:43:20	and then they integrate nfts later or whatever whereas for boom Dow it's kind of we want to put the blockchain first and so what we've done is we've created tools and infrastructure to make it super easy for any game developer to build a game on the blockchain with our tools you can basically deploy a smart contract and configure it for your game within 5 minutes and you can have your game connected to it making onchain calls and recording all of this game data fully on the blockchain we have a

00:43:44	template that's coming out very soon it's going to basically be a template that anyone can use to deploy a template game within 5 minutes and you can swap the art assets for any art assets that you want in your game the logo the images it's basically a way for people to test and play around with you know deploying their own game and what's really cool about this uh template that we've created is that like all the art all the UI is custom made by us so everything is fully open sourceable you can use as as you wish you can mod it

00:44:10	you can you can basically change the game as you wish and we don't care because we just want you to to deploy a blockchain game so we're really excited about that and we hope that we'll get kind of like Indie developers or solo game devs to build a small game on the IC very quickly and have it fully on shame so what's really cool about the standard that boomd created is that now basically the games have the same data standard the same database because the database is the ICP blockchain they can

00:44:33	talk directly with each other the first use case that we' we've made with this is the gaming guilds so in the gaming guilds there's quests and so Gamers can come and play these quests across many different games and the the gaming guilds canister smart contract basically communicates directly to each game smart contract to know whether or not they've completed the quest this is all done just by smart contracts communicating to each other we're working on a launch pad product where the game can release a to

00:44:57	token they can Market their token they can give their token as rewards through the gaming gos Quest it's basically it this full loop there's definitely some other chains that we're watching out it would be really cool to have an integration with something like salana whether it's launching a token on salana that's also paired to the Token on ICP or whether it's having ICP smart contract deploy a salana token and having that managed by a da it's definitely still in the ideation stage but we we definitely know

00:45:25	like there's a ton of usage happening on solo so it' be really cool to get some of that you know transferred to the ICP ecosystem the SNS framework is revolutionary people around the world can vote directly on the code changes that are happening to a Smart contract and so we're really trying to figure out what's the best way for Boom Da to take advantage of of these really cool features of being a DA initially obviously like there requires at least some leadership you know and some decision making but I think the goal is

00:45:54	eventually to have the boomed out ecosystem be run you know by all these different games that are integrated into the ecosystem I'm one of the co-founders tommmy my co-founder is Max I used to work in in AAA game development so I used to work at at Disney for a few years and then at scopely and I worked on AAA games that you know generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and initially we started with just a very small game concept it's been an amazing journey I think uh the ICP ecosystem has been you know absolutely

00:46:24	amazing we love the the technology and that's why we've been here for so many years years we're really excited to to to keep pushing and and growing the the XP gaming vertical for sure if you're interested in getting involved in Boom Out governance the first place you should go is to aex or somewhere where you can get boomed out tokens and then you can go to the nns which is the network nervous system on ICP and basically you stake your boomed out tokens in neurons these neurons are are basically what you use to vote the

00:46:54	neurons have voting power depending on how many boom tokens you Stak in them and you can vote on proposals that are made by the community so anyone can make a proposal if they have a Stak neuron of Boom tokens is uh great to talk to you guys today and uh I really hope that you guys have a wonderful pcpcc if you're interested in learning more about boom Dow you can go to Boom dow. XYZ and I really hope that learn more about the IC and discover that it's the best blockchain out there [Music] all right and that right there was the

00:47:43	clown airdrop and I better be seeing a lot of memes from new clowns let's show the circus let's show everyone what the circus is made of uh next we're going to hear from Kyle langum and I just want to say what's up brother special special speakers and special names and and now we're going to hear from Kyle hi everyone I'm Isaac co-founder here at Vault Vault bet is a decentralized betting exchange built on the internet computer we're bringing gambling on chain to give our players a secure fair and fun way to Bear building

00:48:14	on ICP allows us to bring a truly web three solution to Industry issues and Empower our players to take control of their gambling experience you can currently bet through our sports betting exchange or on a range of lotteries and fun arcade games in ICP CK Bitcoin CK eth and our very own vbt free BET tokens we're building fast and we'll be launching our revamped decentralized sports betting Exchange in May with a brand new design and new features as well as adding more games to Arcade you can keep up with all things Vault bet

00:48:47	with our Twitter at vaet join our Discord join our open chat or go straight to vault.com to place your first bet on the internet computer [Music] [Music] hi I'm Kyle langum I'm the director of data and analytics at definity and I'm here to tell you what the ICP token is used for number one you can do with your ICP token is stake it participate in governance that gives you full control over the entire protocol the second use of the ICP token is to burn it in order to pay for computation and storage on

00:49:40	ICP now this is very similar to gas in other blockchains although it's a little bit different on ICP we have What's called the reverse gas model where it's the developer who burns the token to pay for their application to be hosted this provides a more Web Two like experience where the user doesn't have to worry about the token when they go to use an application just like you don't have to worry about sending Google a fraction of a penny when you do a Google search a developer Burns ICP to create Cycles

00:50:09	Cycles are what they use to actually pay for their computational costs the cycle is Peg to a a Fiat value which creates an interesting dynamic as well on likee a Gen 2 blockchain like ethereum when the network activity goes up the gas fee goes up however in ICP you get the opposite whereas it doesn't affect the gas at all and in addition to that if the price of ICP goes up really what that means is it's making it cheaper for developers to host their application on the internet computer then the final

00:50:35	thing is just like any token it should be a medium of exchange you can use ICP to purchase things like nfts or use defi a lot of ways in which you can use the ICP token just go to ns. i.a that's where you're going to find the nns Dow that also will provide you with some information on how the nns works as well as give you kind of the the overview of the launch pad that is the SNS um great place to start your ICP journey and thank [Music] you how do you protect your digital intellectual property do you depend on

00:52:35	off so shout out to Jerry Banfield you've been doing a phenomenal job with educating others and bringing awareness to the ICP ecosystem we can't thank you enough honestly so keep doing the content keep up the high energy and you know we're looking forward to everything else that you got coming up next um so now you'll hear from Jerry hey everyone this is Matias from the MCS team and this this is MCS scan a DEX tools dap hosted on the internet computer let's Dive Right In and take a closer look MCS scan features a powerful

00:53:07	terminal mode allowing users to view charts token info liquidity pools and recent transactions it also features price alerts notifying you whenever a token reaches your Target price you can even swamp using your favorite dexes directly in MCS scan ditching the hassle of navigating multiple dexes at once all of this and more are coming soon only on the internet [Music] computer I'm jar bfield and I'm going to give you 40 reasons why I'm Allin on internet computer protocol in less than 20 minutes this is based on my 10 years

00:54:05	of experience in crypto and thousands of altcoins that I've researched over the years number one reason is because internet computer protocol is the first true third generation blockchain technology you can build everything on chain this is a huge technological breakthrough that based on where it's valued at today it's way undervalued for this big deal and the second big reason I'm all in on internet computer is that wide diversification is only necessary when investors do not understand what they're doing this means if you

00:54:38	diversify like you hold a bunch of different cryptos you are not generally going to lose as much but you're not going to gain as much either and therefore to me if you combine that with the fact that 99% of alt coins fail to keep up with Bitcoin and ethereum even past their first cycle and we know that there's a very limited number maybe a handful of all coins that will do absolutely amazing and defy the odds that are outliers to me the ideal strategy in crypto is to identify an outlier something that's not like

00:55:14	everything else which is internet computer very obviously and then just go all in on that single outlier while maintaining diversity outside of crypto like having a house you own a car you own employment cash Etc so for me I have 90 plus% of my portfolio on internet computer protocol and I refuse to put any more than you know a small percentage into altcoins even on internet computer and I consider that generally more like charitable investing like I'm I'm going to help some of these projects get started get funding and

00:55:49	contribute to the ecosystem so my all of my meaningful crypto investment is in Internet computer protocol because of what I've said and everything else to me that proves you know nothing else is like internet computer protocol in crypto right now and let's look the fourth reason is look at how Bitcoin and ethereum got to the top they got to the Top by being the first first mover Advantage big advance in technology Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency that was a huge deal I remember finding Bitcoin 2014 and by then there were

00:56:23	already a bunch of copies and forks of Bitcoin and none of them have generally done very well over time but Bitcoin because it was the 0o to one it was the first it's still number one today even though the technology is way outdated same thing for ethereum ethereum Rose to second place because it was a huge advance in having smart contracts where you could make all these other tokens and set things up to operate directly on chain and internet computer protocols the third big breakthrough we've had in

00:56:52	crypto where you can actually build all of your applications from your website database pictures videos nfts code all of it directly on chain you can't do that anywhere else that's a huge deal number five if you look at crypto investing like sports teams defini has got the largest research and development team in blockchain whereas most of these other development teams like Bitcoin you've got a handful of people on the Bitcoin GitHub at this point in the core team many of these other teams you can't

00:57:24	even see the actual engineers in developers that are really working on the code and the foundations the technology of the project definity is so far in way to me the Superstar team in crypto that will be valued accurately eventually and it'll look super obvious in the future and it looks super obvious to me today number six the bigger Bitcoin and ethereum get they have to have scaling solutions to keep using them and the obvious scaling Solution that's ready for Mass adoption is internet computer protocol because the

00:57:57	chainkey Bitcoin chain key ethereum those are by far the most technologically advanced layer 2os we've got and they're both on the same infrastructure if you're into dpin or decentralized physical infrastructure ICP has the best technology for that with h we'll talk more about the exact features of it number eight there's a real problem the internet computer protocol technology has the is in the best position to provide the simplest and most most immediate relief for there we have about $1 trillion a year in

00:58:32	cyber security losses and especially with AI and the more things are being done online the more people are stealing online and ICP and ICP Tech is the best solution and it's the most important solution for crypto because nowhere is more vulnerable to cyber crime than crypto apps where you've got the front end built on regular old infrastructure that is hackable and then you've got crypto assets that can be stolen using those the hacks number nine ICP has never had a real bull market with the price

00:59:05	manipulation when it came out it is extremely exciting to me to see what happens when ICP has a real bull market a full Market cycle that is that that's I'm I'm glad to be in on it at this point because this will be the point a lot of people wish they were in on it at now number 10 we the biggest value I see in terms of crypto or one of the biggest values the technology transforming the world obviously that that can get even a bit too complex for this video to keep it under 20 minutes but one thing we

00:59:40	really need out of crypto is a true alternative to the US dollar and Bitcoin and ethereum to me unless they're on in a layer two are not providing a true alternative for the average person ICP is the only technology that's set up right now that could easily provide an alternative that could be used worldwide as an alternative to the US dollar number 11 most all other crypto projects use centralized hosting which as I said makes them not just vulnerable to hackers but it makes them vulnerable to

01:00:12	Regulators too because their Tech they have these centralized points of failure Regulators can easily go after that and ICP is the only technology where you can set something up and claim true decentralization as alluded to before internet computer protocol having the first Bitcoin and ethereum layer 2 on the same protocol is a massive deal and I'm shocked at how little people have realized this so far it'll in 5 10 Years it'll be so obvious that having the first Bitcoin and ethereum Layer Two on

01:00:42	the same protocol was a huge deal and today I'm we are one of the few people who know about it and understand how big of a deal that is number 13 icp's organic Grassroots based marketing stry to get locally into colleges and to reach the developers that are the wave of the future at less than 1% of the cost other blockchains are suspending through their unsustainable flywheel Marketing Systems I mean this is this is truly forward-thinking marketing it's proven to be what works the best I mean this was very similar to Facebook's

01:01:18	marketing strategy also and I was in on the ground floor of that I saw how well that worked firsthand number 14 Domin IC Williams demoed the first onchain AI in the world AI onchain is going to be very important to keep it secure and out of cyber crime and hacker reach because as it is now ai can easily be hacked and manipulated by Third parties and having AI on chain is the only way it can be trustworthy number 15 ICP is a number one crypto consistently depending on the metrics use and who tracks it on notable

01:01:55	GitHub cont contributions there's a ton of developer activity on here as part of both the team innovating and the community building features and tools ICP has the most advanced and active Dow in all of crypto with more proposals than anything else by far and in fact the second most active Dow is open chat which is an SNS on ICP ICP is the only crypto IC set up for Mass adoption with the reverse gas fee model because ordinary users regular people are not going to pay gas fees to buy nfts to send transactions to use an application

01:02:34	ICP is the only thing we've got set up where you can build to all these applications people I told someone the other day who was shocked I said yeah you don't have to buy any ICP you can just try it out you can sign up with an internet identity you can go into open chat you can try all these other applications you don't have to buy any ICP and they're like really so many people don't do stuff in crypto because they're not going to buy crypto before they do anything so this is the only thing set up for Mass adoption

01:03:04	where a bunch of people could start using ICP without even realizing they're doing so and then we'll natively get into using ICP If you're looking for defi I don't see anything as good as staking in the network nervous system getting 15% APR and voting rewards it's only going to take one person with $100 million to invest to see this and to you know realize this is an easy path to being a billionaire for them and you know I hope you found it before they do number 19 ICP is burned to pay for computation

01:03:39	this is the best use case in all of crypto for burning fees for burning ICP for the fees which means ICP could become deflationary one day and there's an insane amount of real utility for the token nfts on ICP have abs absolutely unmatched functionality making all the old marketplaces totally irrelevant and people are building things like Bitcoin ordinals on bionic on ICP and there's going to be Innovative nfts like you have gold Dow building know gold bars gold stable coin on chain with this technology this is the best technology

01:04:19	to put things like housing directly on chain like a d to a house there's going to be a lot done with nfts on ICP and we can already see how just one little project like bionic can do so much to bring adoption and awareness ICP as I just said because of this functionality is the best place to track real world assets and we've already seen origin get valued around at over and around $100 million as the first protocol to set this up and they they worked a long time to be prepared for that onchain gaming and gambling

01:04:52	gambling is very important to be on chain because there's no way you can really prove that it's fair otherwise and people love crypto gambling so ICP is the best technology to build the crypto gambling apps of the future and for gaming it's going to allow games to be built on chain that are so have so many more Community contributions things you haven't even been able to imagine so far that are going to be really cool if you want to talk about things you can build on ICP that could go viral through

01:05:22	Mass adoption decentralized social media apps alternative to all the applications we use today where ownership can be tokenized we're seeing several of these pop up I use open chat every single day fully on chain I love it and it's only going to take one or two of these apps to really go viral to to blow ICP up and get ICP out to the masses there's several apps on ICP that if they had their own token and were listed on coinbase for example you know they'd be valued at over $100 million there's several of these sleep

01:05:56	apps already on ICP and you can find some of them on the Launchpad the best Launchpad in all of crypto is the ICP Launchpad having created hundreds of millions of dollars in token value being open to the public right now and very easy to use you don't have to have any ICP tokens staked or locked to use the Launchpad like many of these others this is the best place to launch on a new coin today chain key ethereum is the most advanced ethereum layer 2 and we're about to see in the next few months how

01:06:32	big of a deal this is because Bitcoin has been on boarding through cheny Bitcoin it's taken a while to get started but cheny ethereum the community is so much bigger and can do so much more and bring stable coins this is going to be really exciting to see how all these ethereum based stable coins pouring in ICP and the defi systems this is a great time to be in on ICP one of the big things on ICP I see for the future is fully onchain exchanges because the most the biggest place people have got exploited and ripped off has been

01:07:06	centralized exchanges not just the ones that have collapsed but also all the behind the-scenes price manipulation all the extravagant listing fees there's a lot of dirty stuff that goes on with centralized exchanges and that's even the ones that don't collapse icp's got the only technology where we can make these fully onchain exchanges including the website the crypto can stay in your wallet the entire time and work just like a centralized exchange this is the future for exchanging crypto and that

01:07:36	can be set up through icps the most advanced decentralized identity solution allowing all your devices to be authorized this is the best account recovery setup I've ever seen in crypto and in the future one thing that's going to be big governments are going to be able to do kyc and kyt directly through internet ident entities which will then be Mass adoption for crypto and it's a bit naive to think that stuff's not going to happen and to me ICP is the technology where you can Implement that and uh the place where you can Implement

01:08:12	that directly on chain will get support all over the world so it's only ICP right now so how obvious is this you don't even need oracles on ICP and there are oracles currently valued higher than ICP itself for one single little functionality they do and yet look at ICP don't even need oracles anymore because you can build an application on ICP that just pulls data directly into it through the smart contracts that's a far superior setup and makes everything much more simple one reason people have

01:08:45	especially some of the wealthiest people in the world like Elon Musk have publicly chosen not to support things like Bitcoin is because Bitcoin is massively wasteful in terms of energy and computation power which is understandable given how old the technology is internet computer protocols millions of times more energy efficient compared to bitcoin and the more people get into Bitcoin and have a problem with the energy and all the climate stuff ICP is where they're going to end up eventually there's billions of

01:09:15	dollars locked in ICP which cannot move unless the entire account is sold and uh that means that there's going to be some epic Supply crunches one thing I like people have said Dominic Williams the founder of definity is like the new Steve Jobs in crypto to me Dominic has everything I'm looking for and a Founder he speaks well he's his videos helped me see that ICP was different from everything else his vision in crypto and how far he can see into future I was really impressed with unlike anything

01:09:48	else I've seen in crypto Utopia is also if you're wondering many of you are like well aren't Amazon and Google going to fight ICP and take it down no they're going to start running on a private version of this and then that will be interoperable with ICP so companies will have their own private versions and governments militaries they'll have their own private versions of ICP and most will choose to make it interoperable with ICP so that you'll be able to pay and have users and developers go among all the

01:10:21	different uh you know different private versions with the public one that it's it's going to be insane for ICP adoption ICP transactions are final almost instantaneously if you've ever used something like Bitcoin and ethereum that's re once you use ICP to me there's no going back to the other stuff building on ICP from a practical standpoint is way faster than building on other Stacks once you learn how to do it because all the stuff's in one place which makes it so much easier there have been uh people who have not been able to

01:10:51	accurately discuss how much ICP is getting used well if you look at the cycle burn rate depending on how you define it the actual real cycle burn rate the amount which is the best indicator of how much ICP is being used is up 10 to 100 times from launch and 2 to 3x in the last three months extremely solid data about how much it's really getting used the and people are figuring this out there's more than 10,000 addresses in the last few months that have accumulated 100 ICP and the amount of ICP Stak from

01:11:27	launch is up more than double for eight years and not unlocking that's a really good metric and the amount of ICP unlocking is down from 121 million to 45 million while the number locked indefinitely is up from 121 million to 198 million so everything is looking absolutely fantastic for ICP like to me this is this is the absolute perfect opportunity you've been looking for your whole life and as as an example that I've got my website hosted on ICP from even take out the crypto element my website on Jerry banfield.com is more

01:12:03	secure scalable and less expensive versus any other hosting solution believe me I've looked I've tried them this is the best web hosting and that's a very practical non- crypto thing and that's a a great sign of why this is the future so to me anything besides ICP at this point I'm not interested in and uh I'm all in because I want my energy focused so I love ICP I appreciate you watching this and if you want more Jerry Banfield chat with me and join the community at Jerry banfield.com [Music] I hope you caught that airdrop and I

01:12:51	just want to say it was a pleasure to hear from Jerry there Jerry we cannot thank you for the amount of work and effort that you put in seriously keep doing what you're doing it's not easy to make content and it's definitely nerve-wracking like look at me right now um but I do also want to take a moment to highlight some other influencers in the ecosystem and even people that have helped like me with being like a core anchor uh so slayen shout out to you you've seriously been a blessing uh William laurant thank you for always

01:13:16	choosing to like work with me and Daniel our CTO at the Swap Daniel McCoy is going to be here for a panel in a moment um I can't thank you all enough for the amount of work and effort that you put in to help make this ecosystem a better place uh Isaac thank you for the message the other day it means the world to me um and I'll probably get some other people in for some shout outs later so I'll get you in and uh acknowledge you all for amount of work and stuff that you've been doing so thank you all uh

01:13:42	now we're going to go into uh learning about what's going on in the ICP Asia region and that's going to be led by Herbert Yang so check that out now hello everyone I'm Ray from CP index we we are a BTC F driven aring s Management protocol we leverage internet computer Technologies to deliver a suite of BTC five products including Bitcoin cross chain restating lending and borrowing and the decentralized Bitcoin indexer across multiple blockchain networks we address the critical challenge of optimizing the utility of

01:14:16	Bitcoin and its tokens across the defy landscape our product Bitcoin reaking uses State Bitcoin to validate POS chain and earn elds we differentiate our product from others by leveraging the internet computer for development which allows us to utilize bcoin integration and the ckbc for a safer bcoin restating experience our Su of products is related for a face lunch uh beginning in June 2024 please stay tuned [Music] the developers that I have come across in Asia they're very loyal and dedicated

01:15:04	to IC once they commit to a vision to a face even though a lot of them have never met D you know or young imp person but they bore into the vision of broad chain Singularity big time I think number two is uh they're very creative they really know how to engage the users so Asia has a history a track record of creating massive if viral internet applications and we have seen the same pattern in ICP in Asia for example MOA could make quite a bit of a stirred uh in the early December basically became

01:15:37	the the first encryption uh project on ICP the mor team was able to capture on that on the hot moment an old friend for all of us astrox right the team that is now basing in shenen and Hong Kong in China you know and obviously they they created this me wallet that is loved by many in ICP and obviously so we have D you de just uh by active user account the largest web stre application in the industry it's a fun fact that very few people seems to have noticed Dem is we have more than 300,000 daily active

01:16:09	users but they you know they would they were the first to to be able to to create a protocol that can send and receive email um um ICP and so the list goes on so the agent developers very adaptive to the changing uh landscape in the industry which is key to success is that we cannot afford to remains St I think the third part of that is probably sometimes um you know mying from the minds of our our friends in Europe and America about Asia is it's hard to survive here because of the ratory environment we cannot do the same thing

01:16:39	as you guys can you know in other countries you know large amount of Chinese they have to leave their country they have to go to Hong Kong go to Singapore go to Dubai and you know go to Japan now Japan is becoming popular it's very hard when you have to change the world but at the same time being away from your family from your hometown but that's the day-to-day sort of the cost of leaving cost of doing business for a lot of our developer friends uh in ICP in Asia so that has to be factor in it's

01:17:06	not easy it's a very thin rare line that shall not be crossed uh and we have to we have to learn how to make how to thread water very very carefully um so that just added additional challenge for uh developing web Street applications in many Asian countries you know that I I hope I I can you know that can uh that can have more appreciation in other part of the world it's not easy and uh but uh our friends they have always come through I'm KN Fury from House of the Dragon we started as a simple di game as

01:17:47	a response to Johan communist tweet about Randomness on ICP and in 2 months we got more than 2,000 players with more than 7,000 ICP reward already distributed for all the winners and what it makes us different is that we are fully on chain and as the house we're not going to rre anyone because it is provably fair our code is open source and we're going to fully decentralize this platform meaning that every profit of the House of the Dragon will be distributed to the native token holders Dragon ice is a multi-chain platform we

01:18:18	have already evm version live and soon we'll be releasing the Bitcoin version and many other new and popular games like spin slot Blackjack Linko and many more all those games are using ICP as a core engine so go to Dragon ice. XYZ to play and win and become eligible for the native token airdrop you will not regret it [Music] and that was amazing to hear from Herbert Yang there uh from the definity foundation Herbert was one of the first people I've actually met from definity uh when I first entered the ecosystem so

01:19:08	shout out to Herbert really love all the work that you're putting in and bringing adoption to the Asia region um now I'd actually like to take a few moments to um talk about the pcpcc uh we do have uh over 2100 viewers currently across all platforms right now so that's awes awesome this is a massive event for us and so many people are getting onboarded for the first time into the ICP ecosystem so keep pushing those retweets uh posts and all that on socials let's get those links out we have so many

01:19:36	different streams going on on multiple platforms um so make sure you're getting the good word out uh also we do have um the pcpcc SNS Dow that is launching officially tomorrow May 11th at 1500 UTC um also while I have you I do want to remind you all that you should be following the ICP uncore or ICP corcc account on X and uh make sure you're joining the telegram Community uh and then uh quick shout out to Cedric uh I believe he's in Berlin if I'm not mistaken uh I just saw a wonderful photo from the event so shout out to Cedric

01:20:13	and everyone that's attending across the meetups worldwide or in locations um but yeah we we're having a great time here on our end I hope you all are enjoying the conference so far uh make sure you're tagging all of us in post we'd love to be interacting and uh getting some retweets out from people and their experience with the pcpcc broadcast so make sure you're tagging me Kyle theor swap uh I'll be looking through that and retweeting some of my favorites so um thank you all for tuning in so far we

01:20:42	have a lot more to come and soon we'll have some panels so stay tuned hi I'm Andy from Loca mining we're building a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool fully on chain on ICP unlike other chains there's no third party bridge when you bring your Bitcoin to ICP the native Bitcoin itself is not hold by a custodian company but it's h by smart contracts that cannot be controlled by anyone and using ckbc means that it's always back one to one with Native Bitcoin and only you as the owner of the Bitcoin can convert back to the native

01:21:19	version without involving any kyc or any custodian company and one more thing you don't need even need gas fees and by using the programmability of ckbc Loca is building a decentralized Bitcoin mining pool and a permissionless for hash rate Marketplace our decentralized mining pool unlocks a native field protocol where you can actually put your idal Bitcoin to be productive by providing liquidity for Bitcoin Miners and get more Bitcoin out just like Lio but for Bitcoin the difference is that if Lio is getting the yield from

01:21:49	inflation Loca is getting the yield from the Bitcoin mining economy so in this ecosystem in can get Bitcoin at lower than market price by buying po hashr contract directly from Bitcoin miners Bitcoin miners from all over the world can have access to financing so they can buy more mining machines effectively upscale their [Music] operation hey guys I'm Jake ICP on Twitter I'm a software developer in the UK I've been doing it for around five years um with around two years of experience on the IC mainly developing

01:22:29	on vaet which has sort of become my pride and joy I hope you've all heard of it if not you should definitely go check it out um I discovered the boot camp through working with a few devs I've worked with previously from Golden State um who recommended it to me and um I absolutely love the boot camp in itself it was action-packed Seb was a great teacher and I was able to learn absolute ton from from it um so much so that I was able to quit my day job and start working um full-time on vault which has

01:23:02	been really exciting been able to pump out some cool features cool games like ride the bus and crash which you should definitely go and uh play and also working on a whole new Sports Exchange um revamp which is going to be really exciting in future um we've also got a couple new games in the pipeline I won't say what they are just yet but um they're fun for sure sure and um none of this would have been possible without Theo boot camp so I um 100% recommend uh giving it a go if you've not already okay so uh now I'd like to take

01:23:46	the time to acknowledge one of our sponsors it is geek Factory uh geek Factory has uh nft geek and all these other uh amazing daps that are on ICP I definitely use the nft geek quite a bit to do all my tracking for the nfts that I purchase um but yeah now we're going to go into um sorry uh we're going to go into another uh airdrop here soon so make sure you're punching in those codes it's really important that you punch those codes in and uh look for a green message if I'm not mistaken uh and next

01:24:18	we're going to hear from blockchain pill uh after or coming up is blockchain pill so thank you is a blockchain as a service platform aking to a little Google fire days designed for developers aiming to cut C breaking application or web stream using a set of features for front end and ser function developer can build applications such as this demo apps in just a weekend [Music] I'm a I'm running finance and operations at geek Factory hey I'm Dimitri and I'm product lead at geek Factory today I'm

01:25:15	explaining you what we've already built on theic behind geek Factory there's a team of um seven people we as a team we know each other for very long period of time and we were building and investing into web 2 heavily we were one of the Pioneers behind um social networks in Pre faceb dominant era we were always looking for new technologies we discovered definity and internet computer protocol and truly believe that this is the place where web 3 is possible we started to create the products not for the users but uh for

01:25:53	the developers themselves to make the life of the developer easier we are active participants of the community we try to solve the problems uh when we see them by doing so we already accumulated six projects under one umbrella so under geek Factory umbrella we already have six projects I'll briefly talk about them one by one first one is user geek you can think of it as a simple version of mix panel or amplitude but it's 100% on chain it allows you to check your product metrics such as uh active user

01:26:26	Trends engagement retention numbers and conversion funnels and so on so if you want to build on the internet computer or already have a working product and you don't want to compromise your user privacy by sending their data to Google analytics please check user geek then we have a config which is like a Google Firebase remote config tool but again it's written in Moto and it's hosted 100% on the internet computer it allows uh you to configure your product adjust some settings run some product experiments and all in real time the

01:26:57	third tool we have is also for developers it's a tool called canister geek canister geek is where you can monitor your Cycles your memory consumption of all the canisters you have you can see historical charts and you can see prediction of when certain canister will run out of Cycles you can also add logging to your canisters you can top up your canisters directly on canister geek and have full Financial reports on your spending on each canister let's then jump to the projects which can be used by broader audience

01:27:29	next project here is nft geek it Aggregates data from all nft marketplaces which run on IC it has ton of analytics and charts about holders about meeting about transactions about listings about price charts uh about unique wallets and so on and so forth also has a real-time feet and you can snipe some good nfts right when they appear for nft creators it has snapshot tool which can help them to create a list of loyal holders for Rewards or air drops next project is ID geek marketplace where you can securely

01:28:05	transfer sell request alone for your locked assets such as SNS neurons or the whole internet identity so in case of emergency you can check ID geek to find some liquidity for your locked assets for those new in decos system you have a good chance to buy certain assets with a good good discount you got to be quick because uh good offers with like 30 40% discount they disappear in seconds and the last but not least is uh VP geek all you need to know about the icv governance is there the main thing I

01:28:38	want to highlight about VP geek if you want to maximize your yield you can use VP geek to find yourself a perfect neurons to follow VP geek has a lot of analytics and charts about ICP governance so please give it a try ICP is great the technology is there it truly unique when you compare to other blockchain protocols at um geek Factory we truly want ICP to succeed we are looking forward that someday it will be one of the major blockchain protocols we're building the tools to facilitate the growth and maybe to lower some

01:29:13	barriers please join us in this excitement Journey become part of IC Community it's very friendly over here please visit geeka factory. apppp where you can find links to all our products and our social media and please follow us on Twitter join our open chat group or our [Music] Discord and it was great to hear from Geek Factory right there again I'd just like to say thank you geek Factory for sponsoring the pcpcc 2024 I've heard that we are actually over 2500 viewers right now uh with this Global broadcast

01:29:54	so thank you all for tuning in and keeping this uh fun and active for everyone around the world keep sharing those links and let's get more people educated about ICP and now uh we're actually going to have blockchain pill coming up here for a short film uh Alex is going to be introducing a lot of the deps that he finds very interesting and real quick I would like to say Alex thank you for all your incredibly hard work and dedication to making ICP uh ICP a much better ecosystem so shout out to you and all the work that you put in so

01:30:24	let's see what you got struggling with cross tray transactions meet omnity the ultimate decentralized Omni trade protocol designed to revolutionize how you transfer data and assets across blockchains say goodbye to high fees and long wavs with omnity enjoy minimal cost and zero added latency keeping your transaction smooth and Speedy trust is non-negotiable omnity stands strong on trustless verification and relaying fully operated by smart contracts and for our grand finale unparalleled interoperability starting with Bitcoin

01:31:06	ethereum ICP and beyond all this execution change can be connected while omnity and the end result direct cross chain transactions effess and all this amazing features are built on the internet computer together we're making the internet of bro changed a reality ready to Joy the revolution with [Music] us hello and I hope that you're having an amazing time at the iccp Community Conference 2024 my name is Alex and I'm the host of the blockchain pill show today we'll talk about my top three favorite daps built on the internet

01:32:05	computer protocol and the first one is a fully Unchained social media platform similar to Reddit where you get rewarded for posting the second one is an onchain short form content platform similar to Tik Tok but where you can bet whether or not a video will go viral and finally the third one is a fully onchain communication app similar to Whatsapp or telegram where you can create and manage your online community each of those dabs represents a web three alternative to a service that you're already using and

01:32:35	the coolest thing about them is that they are completely decentralized and the community members are part owners and they decide what the future of those platforms is going to be imagine if you had a say in what Tik Tok or Facebook or Instagram would do in the future how cool would that be the first one that we are going to to talk about is called Tagger Tagger is a fully Unchained social media platform similar to Reddit so if you're familiar with Reddit you're going to have an easy time understanding

01:33:04	how to navigate this platform those at the top here are called Realms they're are similar to subreddits they're created by users of the tagger platform and keep in mind that they usually have a theme you want to make your post in the right realm to have a better chance of reaching your target audience and the cool thing is if there is not already a realm for your hobby you can be the one to create it and you will start this trend and people who are interested in this hobby of yours will post in your

01:33:33	realm which is going to give you more benefits for example I'm passionate about working out and creating video content so many of my tagger posts have been from inside the gym or had something to do with video creation or ICP in general you can go to the tagger dashboard to see the leaderboard those are the people who received the most engagement and what's cool about it the people on this dashboard are for the most part not influencers they are regular people that are posting their day-to-day life and are monetizing their

01:34:03	hobbies in order to make a post you need credit and you earn credits back from the engagements that you receive on your post at the end of every week the tagger governance tokens alongside the fees paid by all the users that engage on the platform are distributed to the most active users meaning that the more engagement you receive the more tokens you'll get I invited two tagger ogs to tell us more about the platform so I hope that you'll enjoy my discussion with Ru and mea Kuan let's tell the people who you guys are so Ru is one of

01:34:36	the oldest PE not the oldest users as in as in the age he's one of the oldest users of the platform he has been on the platform almost since the beginning and you are one of the team members of tagger so was was one of the team members was you're no longer a team member well yeah we're decentralized okay right right exactly so R R's as much as a team member as I am and and well you know that's why we're both here because we're representing collectively the tagger Dow right unofficially right but um but yeah

01:35:08	so everyone who holds tagger tokens is effectively a team member let's start with the beginning Ru how did you find tagger so early when did you find it and how did you find it third January 2022 yeah I was in one telegram group where most ogs of IC were there ICP Maximus and they seen a post this is something and okay what is this I have to check it out and when I got I clicked the link and when I got to that screen it was like something of an oldfashioned thing a retro kind of geekish thing like a

01:35:45	messaging board simple very simple with an accent to mechanis design like how incentive structure the working of the interactions between users a play to post model and I said wow this is very cool because this is one of my hobbies making this design and okay this is like wow and I started engaging that's how I got tiger I've been searching tagger on YouTube and there is videos like from two years ago one and a half years ago but uh it seems like recently tagger has been like catching on everybody in the

01:36:18	ICP space is talking about tager people are saying that they are making money by posting on tagger so that's going to be very interesting to to get into what about you megaan how did you get into tagger I was in the same telegram group uh I like to think of myself as a icog as well but but I muted that group because because there was just NeverEnding notifications then my phone was like you know you know all the time so so I muted that group uh and then I saw some of the ogs you know on Twitter

01:36:51	talking about this tagger thing so I was I was literally like you know begging for some of the other ogs can you someone send me an invite code and you know my good friend fire risk he was the one who helped me out with a with an invite code much like Ru it kind of took me it was like a little trip back in time right kind of reminded me of like old school internet message boards you know so I think for like the old geek and me it was new but it felt old you know if that makes sense the irony is a

01:37:18	lot of people right up until recently they they really didn't like the pay to pay to post model and and that was one of the biggest criticisms of tiger and I actually found that quite refreshing quite quite novel at a time because you know you have to think about what you want to write right you have to you know this is going to cost a couple cents right not even a couple cents couple fractions of a scent I found that quite different and new and it did keep Bots and and spam down at the core of what

01:37:47	tager is is a pay to post post to earn um platform that's the essential part of it there's two ways to earn right well actually there's three ways to earn right there's three way so so number one I make a post and you like it um I you know we have credits that are the kind of the monetary instrument of tager R so you pay credits to up vote my post and I earn those credits and those credits are converted um into ICP at the end of each week and I I can earn ICP right just from posting right you can also if

01:38:22	you're you know uh a tagger holder you can also you know give tagger tokens to people who make good content and and and are upvoted right so that's the second way to earn first way is for just general rewards so so forget tagger as a token for for a moment if if that we just take that and push that to the side just posting and getting engagement earns you money just like Twitter so then the other thing is is is the tager tokens right so then the third way is if I hold on to those tagger tokens in my

01:38:52	wallet then I can earn platform Revenue right platform fees so that pay to post model creates platform fees right essentially revenue for the model and because it's decentralized because there's no Central entity that owns the platform that revenue is shared proportionally across all tagger holders so the more tagger you have the bigger like the earning from the platform you're getting right correct that's super interesting and how are you guys leveraging the internet computer protocol Tech to make tagger to a DA and

01:39:24	like first of all let's start at Ground Zero for the people watching what is a DA first of all it's a gathering of people who vote on things to make it happen there is no centralized control nobody dictates this is how things are going and the turnout is based on the majority of the vote in this case the majority of the vote represented by the token holders different weights of the tokens generate the outcome of the vote and this is a big difference because one of the things people don't realize about Dows is that they don't

01:39:59	have a clear uh Direction like you have with a normal company and you say okay this is what I want to do five years Everybody follow me because there is no other way to do it it is more of an organic way of doing things you come now with an idea you spread it people adopt it and then we make it happen this would not happen in a normal structured company this allows for the product to adapt much much more quickly to take into account the voice of the people and to make that voice um to turn that voice

01:40:31	into a tangible thing which makes it valuable for all other users so basically we can move faster we can do more things and is much more intensive I know that tager is built on the internet computer protocol like is this only possible on the internet computer protocol or could tagger exist in in the same form on other blockchains I believe X that developer um was testing it out he had had some experiments on other blockchains and he got to various degrees involved and and basically said you know it's not possible right I mean

01:41:04	there were some where he just from the beginning he said I can't even begin to start so I personally don't believe it's possible um any other blockchain because because of the because basically what what at at the end of the day at the at its very core right internet computer protocol uh is a blockchain that's built on decentralized Hardware infrastructure right so you can put in some code into a canister bucket and that's sitting across decentralized hardware and then the the blockchain protocol is running

01:41:34	on top of that right so I don't know that it'd be able to be built in a decentralized way anywhere else right because you'd have to get AWS you'd have to find some blockchain to run on that and then it would have to have you know all the properties that ICP has so I don't know I I haven't seen it anywhere else I haven't seen anything even close you know people like to talk about steam And Hive and whatever it was so dieso that the guy sold it yeah and a very important additional point to ICP what's

01:42:00	relation to ICP is that it's completely on Shain back end and front end and that yes it is only possible on I to have it completely on I well completely on Shain the tagger project is an innovator in the space what I think is cool is that it passed the test of time it's been running for two years flawlessly which I think is great people are saying they are spending less and less time on X and coming to tagger what what is the magic of tagger why do people come back to it I don't know it seems like a pretty

01:42:28	straightforward easy thing right I mean you don't own your account on X you don't own your account on Facebook or Instagram when you upload your pictures and your post you're you're uploading to their proprietary software and servers right that's housed in a building they have access to I mean they they own it you're just a visitor with tager you own your content the platform doesn't collect any data you can be become an owner of the platform you can share in the revenues people who really believe

01:42:58	in the decentralized model of things um and really have that crypto ethos I don't think there's anything more crypto than tagger you know how many products are sharing their revenues with token holders what I love about tagger is that it is extremely transparent everything that is happening on tagger is visible on the dashboard or on the tokens tab can you talk about how the tagger tokens are minted and get a little bit into the having mechanism and whatever unique feature tagger has it's pretty

01:43:30	straightforward like when you post you receive endorsements those endorsements means credits when you give an endorsement you pay credit the user who receives the endorsement gets those credits and gets what we call reward those rewards at the end of the week are minted into tokens and this is where the ratio comes in every 100,000 tokens minted the ratio goes up it is a little bit more sophisticated than that I'm presenting it in a very straightforward manner because we we made some modifications to the algorithm

01:44:02	but that's pretty much how it goes it uh gets harder and harder the more tokens that are minted so every 100,000 tokens the difficulty increases doubles is there something that you guys wanted to mention that we didn't cover we'll remember probably after after of course yeah thank you very much for tuning in thank you for being open and talking about tagger the second app that I want to show you is called viral viral is a decentralized short form content platform similar to Tik Tok which allows

01:44:30	you to bet on whether or not the video will go viral the idea of viral is to monetize the time we spend glued to our phone while at the same time watching the content that we love to join viral simply go to their website and sign in with Gmail it takes just a few seconds and you're ready to go as soon as you join you'll get some tokens that you can use to bet on the videos in your feed I invited two of the viral Founders to tell us more about the platform so I hope that you'll enjoy our discussion

01:44:59	I'm curious to find out how did you decide to start on the internet computer protocol like what are the advantages that ICP has over all other ecosystems like why was it not possible to have it built on ethereum or on Solana for example I think it started with a really very simple premise and the premise was can we get creators or users to move away from all of these large Behemoth platforms which have all these built in network effects can we get them to move from that to a platform if they were

01:45:28	remunerated for the time that they spent on this platform so if you look at any of these other large platforms they don't actually remunerate their users for the time that they spend on these platforms although these users are the primary source of revenue for these platforms essentially if they are making all the money they don't get anything in return for that so the premise was can we remunerate them for the time that they spend on this so the first version that we had actually created I think

01:45:54	this was around 2019 so back in 2019 we were toying with this idea and it was again a very simple app it only had photo uploads and that's all you could do but uh we built this completely on cloud and essentially the idea was once we had built this photo upload and sort of like the content consumption part of it we wanted to check how we could bring in remuneration for Content creators right so again back then blockchain hadn't blown up in terms of social content still working with blockchain right so back then we were looking at

01:46:27	some Avenues but that is when I think the Bull Run had just started so blockchain really came into The Fray and this cross Star radar like okay this is something that is like blockchain's uh superpowers essentially using blockchain you can actually have somebody in let's say Romania get remunerated for the time and attention that they're bringing to a platform and then they have creators maybe sitting out of different geographies in the world and then uh token transfers essentially value transfers happens very simply without

01:46:58	any boundaries without having any intermediaries without anybody having to step in between so essentially we were pretty convinced that blockchain was the way to go so the next step was now to choose which one right and we had a lot of options back then so I think ethereum was again the Natural Choice we looked at that first however during as The Bull Run was starting around that time most ethereum transaction I'm sure you would also remember it was like one transaction if you wanted to send let's

01:47:27	say $5 in value you're probably spending $100 in gas so this was absolutely unsustainable in our case we wanted to experiment with this idea of microtransaction so imagine if you spent let's say a minute on the platform and let's say you were were supposed to be remunerated a thousands of a fractions of a scent we should have be able to send you that value immediately and instantly right so for every video that you watch for every video that you upload for every game that you play on the platform we want to be able to

01:47:56	remunerate you in real and for that microtransactions had to be a possibility at scale at near zero cost so from that perspective we started looking around we looked at quite a few Solutions so we looked at both L2 Solutions as well as other l1s which called themselves like ethereum Killers right and during that time I think definity had just come out and started testing their main net I think they had Genesis and That Was Then definitely cross our data so then again the price listing action was also bombastic so

01:48:27	that got our attention so we started looking into okay what is this and why is this suddenly listed on number four right on by market cap it suddenly listed on number four and out of the blue so obviously that got us interested and we started looking at the tech again I spent some significant amount of time looking at okay why is this supposed to be the next AWS right and again I think back then definitely also marketed themselves as like the future of cloud that totally got my attention and I started digging into the tech so

01:48:54	although the price sort of kept bombing but the tech was absolutely brilliant I mean amazing and I think as we evaluated further we realized defini uh ICP was the only platform where you could build a social ecosystem the way that we were envisioning it where we could do all these very minuscule microtransactions would be possible no other chain would support this because essentially we needed to find a replacement for our entire back end and our database ICP is is the only protocol right now in the

01:49:25	entire blockchain ecosystem that supports a use case like this not only are the transactions cheap because like there are you know a few other blockchains where the transactions are cheap but the fact that you're able to host an entire dap on chain for you know relatively reasonable prices like compared to ethereum or Solana where there would be like millions of dollars to be able to host stuff on chain I I think that the internet computer protocol excels there and you know we also have the reverse gas fee model

01:49:54	where users don't have to pay you know the small fee that there is they they don't have to pay even that to use the platform so for the people who who are not familiar can you describe like to help people understand how actually the platform works and what it is about yeah it's a very simple platform it's a web3 version of Tik Tok or Instagram reals you can come in and start watching videos without even logging in or uh installing your metamasks or Sana wallets and so on and so forth and at the same time you can now play different

01:50:23	kinds of games mostly voting games wherein you can decide if the video will go viral or not go viral take some tokens against your decision and then in a span of an hour so essentially while the competition ends you either win or lose depending on where the majority is voted so if Alex said this video which Rishi is dancing in is not hard and uh other people shut came in and said this this is hot other people also supported shut Alex loses the tokens that he sticked and invested in rishi's content

01:50:56	it's as simple as that so it's gamification on social content exactly and that gives the opportunity to people that you know spend their time on the platform to also earn for their time and besides the betting on the virality of a video is there any other mechanism for people to use rightly said uh Alexa we operate in a framework of a DA which is a decentralized autonomous organization so now each and every user coming onto the ecosystem is actually a co- founder although depending on how many tokens he

01:51:26	has access to uh his voting power also depends on you know the the Quantum of tokens that he has bought from the market but essentially if Alex is using the platform whatever hot tokens he has earned or acquired or bought some kind of voting power comes to Alex and then subsequently he can take decisions on the future road map of the platform now what happens in this particular framework is all the users are now kind of co-founders co-owners of the entire EOS system and although we are the co-founders who initially started off

01:51:57	with the vision but now after the Dow was incorporated each and every person gets a say on what features should be implemented which direction should the platform should take essentially in addition to this we have also written down smart contracts in which people are incentivized to perform certain actions which adds value to the ecosystem so if Alex uploads videos there's a certain kind of incentive in the form of hot tokens which comes to Alex as soon as the video hits a certain Milestones so

01:52:24	for example the smart contract can say Alex gets 100 likes on the video in a span of 24 hours there'll be 100 hot tokens which will be allocated to Alex so for example you know around $10 $20 or you know some kind of equivalent Us dolls will get allocated and similarly if you're just spending time if you are moderating content again in the framework of a DA if you are uh interacting with other users on the platform if you are gaining followers each and every action is incentivized basically if you are adding value you

01:52:57	will be earning you know some kind of rewards Financial rewards from day one on the web to platforms like Instagram Tik Tok and the others you have to wait literally years it takes around one to two years 3 years before you are able to monetize your following or your content and uh in several cases we have understood that you know people lose interest especially content creators lose interest much before that when uh we talk about a web3 ecosystem the monetization starts from the first minute that you jump onto the platform

01:53:28	and you don't have to wait for years especially for the end consumer not specifically uh you know for Content creators I would say professional content creators generally have access to tens of different platforms there are other benefits for Content creators as well in a web3 ecosystem but for an end consumer there is no other way uh to monetize the time and attention that they spend scolling hours of content on various platforms and platform like honard offers that capab ability for these users to monetize from the first

01:53:56	instant that they jump onto the platform I think that content moderation is one of the most important things for a platform because listen you don't want somebody to join the platform and see a bunch of app that doesn't have anything to do with anything and think like I get a random stream of Randomness which doesn't mean anything that has literally no value we have hired a very small team of uh you know creating some kind of algorithms which basically decides which piece of content should actually come

01:54:23	onto the platform in the first phase and then subsequently the content moderation can also be taken in the hand of the community members so shy if you would just want to you know talk about yeah so actually this is very interesting because I this is really important for Content Discovery so what made Tik Tok so popular is the algorithm which shows you exactly what you want to see so you don't even know what you want to see the algorithm knows better than you what video to feed you next so how are you

01:54:48	guys planning to do this content Discovery just to also talk a bit about where we are and how we came here so essentially if you think about it it's a huge application that we are trying to build and Tackle right so first of all we have this media Pipeline and storage problem where first we take any video that anybody in the entire world can upload and then we figure out okay how do we store it how do we effectively and quickly deliver it to anybody who wants the next cat video or the next car video

01:55:19	that they want to watch right so that is a problem that first we we tried to tackle with decentralization in mind so essentially imagine driving a race car and trying to fix a problem with the race car while the race car is running right so that is what we're trying to we are attempting to do where we have a platform we've built out as much as possible on the blockchain but we also have a couple of offchain components that help us deliver this fast and captivating experience to any user across the world that was the video

01:55:48	content Journey that we initially embarked on and we've managed to solve it to certain degree now going back to your question around content discoverability and moderation the next big investment that we are making in terms of the application and the team that we are building out is in AI so we are currently hiring and have been hiring for the last 3 to four months a lot of AI Specialists who can help us figure out content discoverability essentially so what do I mean by that so right now if you look at the current

01:56:18	feed that's delivered it's pretty static it's pretty static in that if you or Rishi visit the app at the same time you will more or less get the same kind of content being given out to you the reason for this is primarily there's no personalization that we've yet built into the system so essentially right now we only track engagement metrics so things like likees shares how many views a current video is getting and based on that we try to determine okay what what are the most interesting pieces of

01:56:46	content that are part of our library subsequently anybody who's visiting the app for the first time they get delivered a set of videos and as they keep scrolling we give them more videos to the first step for us is to figure out two pieces of this coin one side of the coin is the content itself so all the content that's being uploaded to our platform we need to actually intelligently index the content in this video so imagine we take a look at a lot of signals so we use uh pre-train models essentially we do some sort of frame

01:57:16	snapshotting so imagine if there's like one minute video we take a screenshots so let's say every 10 seconds we take a screen Scot run image analysis on top of that and try and figure out okay what is this particular video about is it a car video is it a cat video is it a nature video is it a video of somebody walking on the beach what it is about the second thing is we look at signals like when you're uploading a video you're also adding some metadata so imagine descriptions imagine tags that you add

01:57:41	to the video and we that also feeds as one of the signals so there's a couple of signals that we look at and we create these things called content embedding so what content embeddings allows us to do is have like a very rich database of Imagine like keywords that we can query against and find out okay this particular user wants a particular category of videos we serve them that so the other part of that coin that I was referring to that is the users preferences so now for every user that signs up with us we maintain sort of

01:58:10	like a interest category for that user so let's say Alex watches a lot of maybe race car videos whereas R she watches a lot of funny cat videos right so we can actually recognize that and store that information in the user canister and then combine these two aspects to figure out okay what are likely videos that Alex specifically likes and what are specific videos that Rishi specifically likes and then deliver that to them so this is the next like Journey that we are currently on where we take in

01:58:38	content from anybody figure out what's in that content tag it sufficiently and put that in our library we do this in a pseudo Anonymous mechanism where we don't invasively track them but then we need to be able to at least look at what what kind of content they're consuming and basis that we try and figure out what is the next set of content that they might find in besides content moderation like this feeding the the users the right content that will keep them on the platform is one of the biggest challenges because you want

01:59:07	people first of all to have fun on the platform and I think that the the three pillars of any successful social media platforms are first of all be able to sustain as many users as want to come to the platform secondly you want to make sure that they are having a great time on the platform and three you want them to be compensated for producing content and I think if you guys nail those three you guys are going to be golden and for the past four months if I'm not mistaken you guys have resolved the issue of you

01:59:36	know being able to onboard as many people as possible so we could talk for hours about this like I feel like we barely scratched the surface thank you very much for tuning in it was a pleasure talking to you and I'm waiting for you guys in 3 months 4 months whenever you want to come send me a message and I'll gladly have you guys back on the show and finally we we've got open chat right now if you want to create a web three Community you really don't have a lot of options most crypto or web three communities happen either

02:00:01	on telegram or Discord but those platforms come with limitations for example if you want to airdrop tokens to your community you need to collect their wallets and then go and use a third party software to do the airdrops or even worse you have to do it manually one wallet at a time and that would take a lot of time this problem and many others are fixed by open chat so let's see how you can get started when you create your open chat account either with your internet Identity or with your Gmail account via nfid you automatically

02:00:33	get a crypto wallet linked to your account and this is great news especially if you want to onboard your non- crypto friends to web 3 because they don't have to go through the hassle of creating a crypto wallet and having to worry about their seed phrase getting lost or losing their wallet and all the bad things that come with that so what are some of the advantages of building your web threee community on open chat compared to Discord or telegram first of all you can create a giveaway inside your open chat community and each member

02:01:02	can claim their share of the airdrop with only one click of a button if someone in your community goes above and beyond trying to help others out you can send them a tip in any of the supported cryptocurrencies available directly inside the app and without having to ask them for their wallet address you can have token gated channels meaning only the users that hold a certain nftd or a certain number of tokens can access it you can create paid channels only accessible if the users pay an entry fee

02:01:33	you can do one-on-one audio or video calls with your friends or with your community members and of course you have all the standard features that Discord and telegram have like sending text and audio messages pictures gifts and videos I've interviewed the Open chat Founders and the video will soon be live on my YouTube channel so please consider subscribing so that you don't miss this video when it comes out and I want to remind to you that ICP is the only blockchain which allows entire daps to

02:02:01	exist on the blockchain and not just tokens or little bits of defi logic this level of innovation has never been seen in the crypto space and we're witnessing it here firsthand on the internet computer protocol I hope you enjoyed this video and are having a great time watching ICP Community Conference 2024 and hopefully we'll see you in the ICP Community very soon soon thank you for watching my name is Alex and I'll see you in the next video and it was great to hear from blockchain pill there again shout out to

02:02:36	Alex you've been doing an incredible job with your content creation on ICP keep spreading the good word and educating others and letting people know what's going on in the ecosystem uh now I'd like to take a moment to uh announce the the Meetup locations that we have across the world and I do want to apologize in advance cuz I'm probably going to butcher some of these uh they're you know they is going to be a little tough for me real quick but uh I want to say shout out to uh Bulan Shar nirobi coochi

02:03:06	cira colum uh gent Berlin Bali sonola carcass buenos Ares uh if IDs is there shout out to you guys um then we have Yola not to get confused with yolo then we have kalala which I believe crypto girl might be there uh so shout out to you as well Costa De capar and then uh London clug uh CL naoka sorry uh Miami Silicon Valley New York City Washington DC Milwaukee as we're here uh Austin Kula Lampur which I believe I did a interview with the big broadcast there too so shout out to you guys uh Santiago de

02:03:47	Chile and so that's all the meetups happening around across the world right now uh again three locations so shout out to you all for making this day so special this is a very historic moment as we are on the second annual ICP CC Community well ICP Community Conference uh so yeah thank you all for making this such a special day and I just want to say make sure you're using the ICP CC 2024 hash let's keep spreading the good word I know we're around 3,000 viewers if not beyond that at this point um but

02:04:16	yeah we're going to about to explore some nodes here on ICP so let's go IC Lighthouse is a defi company leveraging the advanced technology of the IC to put out revolutionary tools and products for the ICP ecosystem and the Heart of our product releases is a fully onchain decentralized exchange known as icy de governed by Icy Lighthouse Dow icy de has live order books a plethora of unique order types including things like stop limits and grid orders and an Innovative new amm style pooling structure which ties directly to our

02:04:57	order books this keeps liquidity provision simplistic secure and easy to manage to learn more or try out our platform please visit .io [Music] [Music] hi everybody at the uh iccc I'm Louise valo I am part of the team at av8 Labs we're based here in Belgium and I'm currently doing this from from Brussels so if there's any of you in belg feel free to give us a shout but just a bit about aviate Labs so aviate Labs aims to enhance the infrastructure around the IC which effectively creates a sub ecosystem around nodes and node

02:06:05	providers within the internet computer how have we done that already well on the one hand we've open sourced our notification service so that node providers can know instantly as soon as their nodes go down but on the other side we're looking into ways to provide some kind of technical support service for providers so that if their nodes do go down they can have somebody who will be first to respond and effectively do the basic troubleshooting steps before escalating it with their service providers our mission is to streamline

02:06:35	node management and facilitate scalability and together we believe this will help grow the IC to the point where it can rival with today's web 2 Giants it's a high performance server that provides comput and memory capacity to the internet computer what you see on the internet computer dashboard compared to other networks a node really refers to a single machine and these machines are operated by us node providers they are operated by independent entities which are the node providers and they operate in many

02:07:16	different countries even in different data centers so there you have three degrees where their own by completely separate entities and run in different geographical locations so they're not under one regulation and on top of that even the places that they are housed in the data centers not one small entity has control over a lot of these nodes so the fact that you have this kind of 3° it's really hard to tamper with a node take us as a node provider for example even if we would just decide to shut off

02:07:48	our nodes there's still the other nodes from all the other node providers it's just hard to seize control over the network just cuz you have physical access to a couple of notes just about 1,500 nodes 559 as it says on the dashboard that are currently active so there you can see there's a bit of uh spare capacity you can say which is definitely not a bad problem to have but that's where we need events like this to talk more about the internet computer and get more developers on it cuz as you can see

02:08:20	there's definitely capacity for more applications to be built I'm seeing nodes popping up in Japan I know there's one upcoming in New Zealand there's nodes in Singapore Hong Kong a node provider in South Africa Latin America you can set up a node anywhere I think the the biggest limitation or the reason why also you still continue to see higher concentrations forming in the Americas and in Europe is largely due to costs in some places it is just extremely expensive to set up a node and the biggest let's say culprit of that

02:08:51	has been been connectivity cost internet costs living here in Europe and in these more developed countries we benefit from kind of the connectivity everywhere and and the prices show that it's quite accessible but let's not stop there ideally we should have a node everywhere on the world at least one even in Antarctica even we're currently focused on node providers who are operational and providing tools to support them a big part of growing the internet computer is also helping new node providers on board

02:09:21	the best way we can help you do that is to help you navigate all the information that's on the IC Wiki everything on the internet computer Wiki all the information is there on how to set up a node but like running noes or any other web through project if you really want to get to it it takes some time to really read it and really go through the whole process and so what we can do which is which I'm always happy to do is any interested node provider I'm happy to hop on a quick call just to talk about just to further explain the

02:09:49	process make it a bit more clear give them a couple of links to direct them in the right places just so that they don't have to do the whole deciphering of the entire Wiki you can find the hardware specs on the internet computer Wiki basically these specs are very similar to what you would see in any cloud computing environment in principle the internet computer functions as this decentralized Cloud it provides a platform for developers to be able to create blockchain applications on some other

02:10:22	infrastructure that they don't have to manage could be seen as similar to AWS but in a completely decentralized way it has a lot of high performance CPUs and also a lot of memory and storage space to facilitate your applications the biggest difference between a node on the IC compared to nodes in other networks and this is why I put that quotation mark is that nodes on the IC really refer to a dedicated server machine when you look at the internet computer dashboard and you see that there's around 1,500 noes that

02:10:59	means there's 1,500 servers that are running the icos to date contrast that with another Network like ethereum you can spin up that's Os or the nodes through Cloud instances like Amazon there's actually not a dedicated hardware for the node for this blockchain network so for those of you familiar you could easily spin up an instance on some AWS service and that's actually running on the same physical machine as some other service from some other application might not even be blockchain related but the point is that

02:11:32	there's no dedicated Hardware the actual Hardware that's being used to run maybe some other blockchain networks is actually then owned by a cloud provider and that's what really makes IC node so different is the fact that they are these dedicated servers and that equals one node it really makes it decentralized because there's no way to hide it there's no way to group it all together it really means that if you're a node provider you are managing this amount of servers because that's the amount of nodes you're

02:12:02	running it's more that there needs to be a standard way some kind of framework to be able to compare the decentralization of blockchains it's possible that that changes over time because of what different people start to think about oh what actually constitutes the decentralization of a blockchain we work in Tech and blockchain is is very volatile it changes a lot and so too can the metrics that we use to measure decentralization what's important is that there is a framework that is somewhat standard so that you could plug

02:12:32	in a bunch of blockchains and you say that oh we're going to compare them based on these metrics and then based on that you can then come out with a ranking of which blockchain is more or less decentralized and I think having a framework like this will be important to help decision makers in the future so I talk about you know facilitating that process from web 2 to web 3 a big value proposition of web 3 is this whole decentralization thing but if we don't really have a way to to measure this how

02:13:02	can you make it so that you can convince somebody to take their operations and one switch over but then two if they really want it to be the best decentralized application ever they will need a way to be able to say blockchain x is more decentralized than blockchain why and for this we need metrics and and a way to to compare prare blockchains based off [Music] decentralization and we're back everyone so as you should know by now uh my name is Kyle and I'm the founder of the Swap and I'm joining here by our CTO Daniel

02:13:53	McCoy so real quick I I know a lot of you have been you know kind of wondering what we're up to with the swap as we you know expand our media um you know when we first started back in August of 2021 we've kind of transitioned into doing a bunch of spaces we've even had great guests like Dominic Williams and recently we actually had Sandy Carter as the ex vice president of Amazon web services that was a really cool one as well um but as we were kind of rolling out and you know getting to the end goal

02:14:20	of our vision is you know we want to build this culture kind of like this trendy news kind of like like a thrasher meets Rolling Stone but really web 3 and highlighting what is in web 3 which is those communities because that's what really makes this all special so thank you to pcpcc Coden state for allowing us to have this moment today and make history with you all here for the second annual pcpcc uh with you know our vision as we roll out we want to you know update people with news and you know get get to

02:14:52	bigger scale events as as ICP gets adopted more um and you know one of our sectors that we're really focused on is also gaming and we have a bunch of 3D assets and stuff with it'll be like VR AR and all that but a big Focus point for us is go to gamer and getting automated tournament tooling and League creation uh in the ecosystem here so we're really focused and determined to getting automated leagues formed on ICP maybe even you know using API to grab uh you know uh data from your favorite AAA

02:15:25	games such as Call of Duty and fortnite and so on but I'm going to skip past that and give it over to Daniel for the technicals which he can tell you all about but that is what we're focused on with the Swap and Daniel will give you the technical details yeah hey uh it's great to be here um thank you for the wonderful introduction uh yeah so we've been working on quite a lot of stuff for the last I would say two two and a half years um two of those big things are go to gamer platform and the uh the swap

02:15:55	news platform because of the entertainment industry bringing the gaming together with the tech stuff um it's really been quite the journey quite the challenge um but we're very um very passionate about it and we're pretty far in production with it so first I should dig into go to gamer so as he mentioned it is a competitive tournaments platform for uh competitive Gamers leagues leaderboards um on and off chain game data uh basically whatever we can collect um and then Tak in the name of decentralization so that you actually

02:16:28	own that data um and we mix it in really nicely with like the swap news app which is going to be a multiplatform uh fully onchain app that you'll be able to uh creators will be able to access and post articles videos um updates to their to their um to their to their user base and pretty much we're going to kind of have a large collection of some of the top projects at first and then go further into um all of the wonderful like friends and partners that we have including you know some of the uh projects that are um on the on the

02:17:09	banners you know bionic and them um so we're going to have a lot of that posted up on there um and actually we're putting it all Under One Roof now so coming hopefully this week for full release will be our brand new website the swap. XYZ uh it will actually embody go to gamer the news app and all of our content Under One Roof with a central login so you'll log in with an internet identity and you'll be able to access your go to gamer stuff the news stuff any website stuff and we have a special

02:17:43	surprise with the um Bitcoin and ethereum Astronaut airdrop that has recently gone out and it hopefully will be live very soon uh in all the wallets and you'll be able to go to the site log in and download one of many high high quality pfps as well as copies of all the 3D models that will come with the collection so we're super excited for that uh you guys will find if you go to the site you will find a get goed button it currently is not active but it is there um and you'll go to that click on

02:18:16	that uh watch out for our post we'll give you instructions and then you hopefully you guys will really love those assets because uh we we put a lot of time into that so I think uh the last thing I wanted to mention was uh the uh we have two new things we're adding to our website okay uh so uh you know real quick to uh we do have other NF nfts of swap OG which is on tonic we have go to gamer which is also tonic and bionic the new CK BTC Market Marketplace by bionic um and we're doing some stuff with as

02:18:55	Daniel mentioned with Bitcoin astronauts uh it's a vrm so a virtual reality model uh which will get a lot of support from us and we'll include some future updates with that so people can get these assets download them as Danel Daniel mentioned um and you know we'll add in an ICP one and all the the future uh like Integrations that we add to ICP but you know uh as far as you know who we're working with with with these vrm models is inside dark Studio who's a deep deeply connected partner to us as we

02:19:27	kind of explore and get into this VR AR world as we all kind of experience the metaverse for the real first time so ICP definitely helps us like get to this Mission as with uh you know the Integrations that we have um but yeah I I think uh Daniel did a great job with covering what we're where we're heading and you know we're excited to explore this journey with you all and even get to more events uh later today we'll have people coming in in a couple hours we didn't want to stress everyone with the

02:19:58	broadcast uh early on so I hope you're all enjoying it and we'll get back to what's to come with the pcpcc so thank you all hi there this is pet from monai I participated in the first online boot camp and also in the first iners one in Porto last year it was awesome to Kickstart my Moto skills learn more about the IC and become part of the community still in contact with many of the participants and I always cheer when I see their work in the ecosystem during the boot camp I built the notorious

02:20:37	seagull style and also worked on the open internet metaverse which I continued afterwards oim lets you create and host 3D virtual spaces like websites on the IC now as part of onai I'm working on decentralized AI like this fully decentralized AI chat app so clear recommendation from my site to join Motu boot camp is your fast lane into the IC ecosystem and web 3 [Music] [Music] [Music] welcome to the digital art showcase Gallery my name is Glenn and I started this initiative last year as a community

02:21:39	project to support artists gain disability I have literally been carrying a dig art frame around London so that people can appreciate the adct in its correct form now we're looking to utilize the onchain capabilities of the internet computer blockchain we can ensure that artist support is decided by the community and not by myself or a marketplace with ICP we wanted to get to the stage where the community can vote on Art submitted by the artist the artworks that get behind spes are then minted then appears on a network of

02:22:13	frames around the globe and not only that but in the metaverse as well all of the artworks that are minted are promoted by the community and the community are rewarded for this engagement this will create immense visibility for the artists if you know the sound bar project please make sure you're following at digital art show on X thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed the show today I think the cus did [Music] all right and we are back and I just want to take a brief moment to you know just remind you all that tomorrow we

02:22:57	have the ICPC SNS St so make sure you are tuned in if you're interested in participating in that because the first 80,000 ICP raised is going to earn you a multiplier if you're in that first uh participant round um so make sure you're checking that out again that starts at, 1500 UTC and uh you know help us with achieving a greater Mission if you're interested in partaking in uh the ICPC SNS now I do want to give another shout out because we have William laurant coming up very soon uh with a message of his art and I I

02:23:31	believe you'll actually see me in an interview there too so I know uh William has done a lot with the content and I hope you really enjoy what he has to offer because William is a very passionate individual and pretty much like the number one supporter of ICP If you look at all of his signs he's hold holding up out in public uh shout out to William you're doing a tremendous job my my friend uh I really appreciate all the work that you do and the the thoughtfulness of the messages you convey so here's to you man

02:23:58	enjoy your enjoy your moment here on the iccc hi everyone I'm William Lorent it is a beautiful day here in Fuji Sawa Japan and a wonderful day to welcome you into my home studio here to talk about the internet computer protocol but I wanted to pick the brains on some real expert influencers in ICP about how we could grow this community and really get more people excited about this incredible technology about this incredible community and uh make people feel comfortable safe secure and help them to have fun so the first person I

02:24:36	wanted to talk to is the legend Bitcoin Renegade let's pick his brain today hey everyone hey everyone I am back and I'm here with Bitcoin Renegade he is as you know the founder of the ICP Renegades nfts thank you so much for joining us Jeff how are you today I'm good man I'm just excited for this and just can't wait to hear what we have Yeah man so yeah me too I was actually in Florida last year at Coden State uh this year I'm in Tokyo so I'm doing this remotely but uh I had really one question for you I've been asking a

02:25:15	lot of people in the ecosystem a lot of ICP influencers and the question is and you can take this any direction that you want is an age-old question how do we break out of our Echo Chambers now on social media how do we expand the user base for ICP in a way that is organic in a way that's not shilly in a way that's ethical like um I make a post on Twitter and I'll get tons of Engagement from ICP but very few outside the ecosystem like what is the solution for this how do we get more people in to use

02:25:52	products man that's a great question so the thing that I think of when I want to be a part of the community is a thriving ecosystem of cool stuff going on right um and and the community behind that as well so if you have a really negative Community it won't be as good so the cool thing about the internet computer is it is a big meme coin um blockchain which has a lot of uh the layer 2 meme coins like ghost and and these newer ones like clown and stuff but this this creates an atmosphere of fun so the the

02:26:32	thing is not only how do we get people to come into the ecosystem which would be the fun the memes you know the technology the daps like you know using these decks as like ICP swap you can launch a token on there we could have developers come from other chains to build on the internet computer um but but then also that kind of you know sense of community that we have here and I think those are important but we also need to learn how to keep people from other blockchains that's the thing we have a lot like you said you get a lot

02:27:03	of Engagement and I know people outside of the ecosystem see that engagement and they they want to be a part of it but then they come in and they're like well why am I staying so I think we need to concentrate to get them in here the fun the family type you know atmosphere and just a lot of money to be made you know with with these projects possibly and then keep them here that is going to be the next big challenge after we get the people here so I think that's where we're going that's right it's that

02:27:35	stickiness right it and you can't just throw uh airdrops at people or throw a little bit of money or throw some nfts because they won't stick um it has to be some like what's in it for me recurring uh reward on a regular basis whether it's uh gaining a social following gaining clout monetizing your content making money somehow so yeah no that's a that's a great question we could take that in a million different directions but let's just bookmark it there and um you gave I think some great ideas for

02:28:05	the the community thanks Jeff yeah anytime I'm just glad okay what is the conclusion there fun fun he says we need to make everything fun I totally agree I have the same conclusion um on my end I've turned to really three asymmetrical marketing hacks that I think are fun and hopefully can cultivate fun that's holding Twitter spaces uh holding signs about ICP or doing short form content on LinkedIn or Twitter that tells like a fun story about ICP or a compelling you know vignette and tie it back to the

02:28:43	technology with uh an eye-catching AI piece of art right that I have open chat generate and the third is doing songs about ICP and yeah it's corny but it gets people's attention and as far as I know with no apologies to rappers that there's nobody else doing songs about crypto where they play their own instruments they write the songs they sing the songs themselves so I'd like to think at least in this very very small world I'm sort of setting a trend [Music] I see PE racing up the charts looks like

02:29:27	a crypto over save a dance for me the journey here has just begun my bags are in the sun it is C to [Music] can we get this toen to at all time high feels like stoping over I know my love for R CP will never [Music] die okay let's go back to Twitter spaces for a second the reason why I love Twitter spaces I never know who's going to crash the party I don't always know where the conversation's going to go we try and structure these things but sometimes it becomes bedum so here's a great example recently we had blockchain

02:30:51	boy as a guest and he started talking about how we need a meme coin in the ICP ecosystem and that we should have a clown coin two weeks later it came true let's take a a listen to this it's hilarious like I've learned that an army of R is really powerful we need to build an army of retards for for ICP guys we need to get them Shilling some I when is there going to be like a a clown token or some [Music] okay well there are so many highlights that I could have played when I had blockchain boy on my Twitter space

02:31:31	before that's just one of them um the other ones I'd probably have to censor a little bit more but let's stay on the theme of Twitter spaces so speaking of Twitter spaces I wanted to invite my longtime Twitter space co-host Michelle Lord to speak a little bit about her experience coming into the ICP ecosystem and her just impressions of ICP how we might be able to better cultivate her community to be able to better on board people to our ecosystem I'm so thrilled to have Michelle with me she's been a big part

02:32:04	of my journey in ICP and my journey in crypto Michelle thank you so much for joining yeah thanks for having me I'm thrilled to be here I'm always excited to join you William let's go I'm thrilled because one of the things that you do is you sort of always provide a perspective that I haven't seen and ground me in reality and and that grounding really is I came into ICP ecosystem before you did so I've absorbed a lot of alpha a lot of info and then you came in after me and I was sort of always out there like talking

02:32:37	about this and that and you needed to pull me back down and say wait you got to onboard me properly you got to let me know what's this D app is what this means what that means so um I learned a lot about Community about onboarding and how I should best talk about ICP Community um because of your experience um so I guess the onboarding for me was you know I I'm pretty um quick to you know jump in and and try and learn but not so quick to um necessarily act and so I SP lot of time just listening and

02:33:16	learning and asking questions and trying to figure it out um when um you know once I I really started to um get into open chat it really opened um ICP up for me because there's just a Hu community of just people like the smartest I've met um are within the ICP um ecosystem so that's just been really exciting me from an intellectual standpoint um and uh some of the challenges are that um there's so much text being built and so projects that you know um still in in you know the building stages that I'm a Creator and I

02:33:58	want to get in and get my hands dirty and I want to play with stuff and I want to test it and try it I want to do stuff and uh so you know that's just that's been a challenge for me because I want to meet creators that are doing stuff and I want to meet the the nft place Builders and you know and so you know we spent a lot of time talking to um The Hub which is great because that it seems like they're really growing the um the learning and like encouraging the devs and yeah gives you the the that 10,000 foot

02:34:36	of a project you know yeah we forget how early we are but when I look at our journey we we came into web 3 I think at the same time maybe three years ago and um this was another decentralized web 3 platform and the amazing thing is okay we keep telling ourselves that we're early but on this other decentralized platform which is not ICP we will have more followers on that decentralized platform than we have on Twitter right so you know it's we see the uh momentum there like we see what's going to happen like we've been

02:35:15	monetizing on that platform we've been monetizing on tager I'm pretty sure I don't know how long it's going to happen but in a couple years we're going to turn around and going to say you know what we have more followers on tiger or on dscvr or on some of these other ICP platforms than we do on Legacy social media which for us I think would be Twitter uh Facebook nobody uses anymore Instagram I'm pretty much done with uh there is LinkedIn but that's sort of a different thing I'd love to see a decentralized LinkedIn build on ICP but

02:35:47	we're early but we're seeing things happening now right uh you were a big part of definity and icp's Presence at Bitcoin Miami in 2023 and we spent a lot of time in conversations with people that either didn't know about ICP or knew about it but thought that oh it was some sort of scam or whatever because the price action that happened when the token was first released um what takeaways what lessons from the time that you spent in Miami talking about ICP uh would you uh want to share with us about like what's

02:36:35	the best way to have conversations about ICP with people that don't necessarily know about the product or about the technology like how do how do we like rope them in and get their attention that's a great question and I can only speak from my personal experience um obviously my time at um Bitcoin Miami was um engaging people in conversations about ICP and um uh CK BTC so what I found was that people were so excited that there was an ICP presence I it was overwhelming people were like you know having this shirt on that said you

02:37:19	know internet computer like you know like talk to me to get free ICP um so people were just so excited they're like oh icp's here icp's here and I wasn't expecting that I was expecting not so there wasn't a booth so we were we were it and I was people not to know who we were I thought it was you know kind of a under the cover kind of thing but it wasn't people were super excited and oh my God yes I know ICP oh I interview Dom oh oh I do videos for ICP like I mean everyone we talk to knew what ICP was I didn't have to introduce

02:38:01	ICP yeah that was that was amazing and yeah people were coming out of the woodwork like there were influencers that were say hey you with ICP are you with affinity because we had the shirts on right that said talk to me about getting free CK BTC and um you know the response was just incredible like just oh wow yeah what's going on like what's going on I love the technology I love the solution stack uh people were very very curious and they were starved just for more info so that was such a a fun

02:38:34	time to be able to connect with so many people and you know I did a lot of that in Miami at women and web 3 and other uh through other mediums and to see the result of of maybe 20 or 30 of us that were just out there all the time in like a marketing type of swarm or doing like just gorilla evangelism that really made a huge difference over the last year hasn't it yeah absolutely I mean even like going to our basil and just you know wearing my ICP hat people were like oh ICP ICP so it's it is it's super exciting

02:39:16	and I think that whatever the fud was I didn't hear it and I don't hear it now yeah it's almost all gone isn't it it's almost all gone in fact I rarely really see it right now and the fud is sort of changed the little bit of a Fang shwe thing it's not that oh ICP sucks it's a scam it's a rug pull now it's become oh that's cool but my blockchain is better than your blockchain salana is better cardano is better so then it becomes not necessarily fun it becomes more of a religious argument and that's fine

02:39:47	because we'll win that argument every time if we actually want to have it Fantastico okay staying with the Twitter spaces theme let's hear from another ICP Legend a guy that happened to be my co-host on my Twitter space for the last few months the Swap and I want to hear what he has to say about how we might be able to better uh strengthen our community here in the internet computer so we have with us the swap today and he's going to talk a little bit about his project and how that project is helping us as an ecosystem

02:40:24	punch out of our Echo Chambers and on board new fresh users into the ICP Community swap thanks so much for joining us what you got going on yeah I appreciate William um so yeah for those of you don't know me I'm Kyle I'm the founder of the swap uh we also just launched uh go to gamer today for those of you that aren't familiar with go to gamer uh we have our first collection on ICP we just launched on I iic Market uh which is created by Bob bodley and easy Steve uh the creators of tonic Marketplace and so yeah for growing the

02:40:58	ecosystem today I had like my big stressor uh Daniel was gone he was on a business trip so I was like stuck all alone handling all the tasks and stuff and um I mean I'm very familiar with ordinals and you know I'm very familiar with ICP uh but today I just got like rocked with questions back and forth between uh people trying to answer what they thought would work for C kbtc and reverse ordinal or Reserve ordinals sorry my apologies uh Reserve ordinals so it's reserved until you inscribe it to bitcoin um so yeah uh I had a lot of

02:41:34	questions while people were hounding me on social media while they're in my Discord and all that um so I'm familiar with how to pitch people on the IC to how to use CK BTC uh but I had a lot of people that were like oh I can use this wallet this is great like this is you know you know what I use in ordinals and I'm like no you you can't use that you can't send it to that and uh so I had to like really onboard like these communities and um thankfully honey badger shout out to them uh they're a great uh ordinal Community they do a lot

02:42:05	of alpha calls and so on uh they were excellent today um they really gave us a boost and uh over the last like I'd say five six months I've just been really good about like going out and branching out into other communities uh maybe buying one of their nfts or ordinals or you know several of them you know to become like a Community member and really get to know everyone inside there that way I knew like how to like approach people with what they were interested in for Tech and um you know Community incentives and and so on so um

02:42:36	I would say that's probably a good way because then you start to know your audience and your demographic that you're really going to so um kind of breaks down that barrier because you kind of set up like a friend Point prior to like hey like I think think you would enjoy this Tech and so on yeah that's just kind of my you show that you have skin in the game I love that answer right so I mean you're holding an nft in this ecosystem it gives you uh you know Street Credibility with that ecosystem yeah absolutely I think that's

02:43:04	so important because you know why is someone gonna just go out of their way and support you if it's not reciprocated right like right I just think that's like a common rule of thumb like help me help you and um you know from from my day in the service industry like back in college and so on like I managed bars nightclubs and all that um so like basically dealt with a lot of CEOs and you know it's about creating like friendships right more than in his business you want to work with people you're friends with right it just makes

02:43:39	it more tolerable and easy to get along and I think that really just kind of translates into web 3 we want we want to have fun so I I think you know if you can give people um that fun factor that they're all looking for they're going to be more you know inclined to uh learning about what it is that you like for Tech and you know other areas of of Interest so I hope that answers all your questions no I love it so so I just talked to bitcoin Renegade and the word fun came up again right so uh we definitely lose sight of that we get so

02:44:14	serious and in bogged down in some other details but at the end of the day people want they want positive energy of course they want green candles they want to make money but they they want to feel like uh they can trust the technology etc etc but they also here because they want that endorphin rush they want to have fun with their friends make new friends so great great answer thank you so much okay keeping it real 247 speaking of 247 and being on it around the clock I thought it'd be a great idea if we

02:44:44	talked to one of my favorite people in the ecosystem six figs it's always a pleasure to be on his show uh he's great at editing out all my mistakes I also want to invite Michelle back and make sure that she uh Keeps Us in line and that we go don't go off topic too much so let's hear from six figs about things that we might be able to do to punch out of our Echo Chambers and get more really cool valuable people into the ICP ecosystem okay hello ICP family Michelle and I are here with the remarkable with

02:45:20	the legendary six figs Kyle thank you so much for joining us now I wanted to get a couple minutes of Kyle's thought leadership on what is the best way to continue building the ICP Community how do we break out of our Echo Chambers whether it's on Twitter whether it's on YouTube you know all across social media we've been doing a good job I think the last couple years of defunding the uh crypto world right you no longer hear people talking crap about iccp it's a scam this and that now we got to take it to the next level so Kyle

02:45:55	how do we take things to the next level how do we break out of this ICP Echo chamber and tell people that are in ethereum and in the salana in the cardano about how great this product and this platform really is yeah yeah no thanks for having me on and um you know when it comes down to like that I I think like we need to just keep in mind like what exactly is ICP trying to do they're trying to be this cloud-based platform that all these other chains because let's face it as great as ICP may be and it Superior to all of them

02:46:31	when it comes down to it these chains will exist these communities will exist because they're strong and with that said there are a lot of flaws within a lot of these chains where ICP can step in and help and I do think that there are are a lot of and I want to just say that this is more of like a Strongarm partnership or collaboration forced by definity onto all these other blockchains and communities and what I'm talking about is when definity comes out with CK BTC or C CK Soul or let's just say CK eth for that matter definity is

02:47:11	strong arming their way into those ecosystems and into those communities so I think like the best approach would be to have the community approach all these other people that are in these like great ecosystems and just try to maybe identify weaknesses in the chain and really start to Champion these other chains um you know I guess I should say without highlighting their weaknesses so much but we could almost say like hey salana it's got a great ecosystem it's got a great Community but guess what

02:47:47	when it's up yeah when it's up when it's up but it's it's a nightmare to store data on chain like let's break these handcuffs free let's store this data on chain at the internet computer for pennies on the dollar so I think like if we just take that type of approach and really start to um you know uh work that angle onto a lot of like these developers and things like that um you know the the the communities and other ecosystems really don't need to know that things are being stored on ICP things like that but I I don't know for

02:48:22	me that's a Breaking Point like if you can be fully onchain doesn't matter if part of your project is on some other blockchain like dies or you know ethereum or salana and then you can have a little bit of storage going on you know on internet computer like it's just a win-win for everybody so I think like yeah just embracing these Force you know these these strong arm collaborations that definity is uh presenting to us uh you know that might be one way without dragging the other chains through the

02:48:56	mud to so what about so okay so we get their attention right so we sell the value proposition then it's the onboarding so what is the the what is the Trojan Horse to get people onto ICP is it nfts is it social media like tiger like is it defi what do you think is the killer app or killer apps that people that you know maybe exist already on ICP or that people want to see on ICP that will help us get them in that funnel and part of the ecosystem you know you know with all due respect to like all the applications and

02:49:35	stuff like that um on the IC I think like we really just there's so many great apps but we just don't have anything that has that wow factor yet but I do think that there is going to be a potential massive onboarding event especially once definity is able to lock in some of these chainkey stable coins and this is going to allow some of these dexes uh to really really grow because now people will be able to just take profits in Stables right that's huge for a Trader so I I think like the next like

02:50:13	iron that we need to strike is these chain key stable coins coming out and do think like a lot of these Premier dexes are going to really um really influence a lot of people into the internet computer ecosystem uh you know just for that and I know there's like a lot of stable coins and stuff like that on other chains and stuff like that um but you know you got there's just so much going for internet computer it's speed it's reg reverse gas model things like that um but yeah you know I I think the

02:50:47	dexes are going to lure in a lot of people people um you know as far as like the nft marketplaces there's a lot of good stuff going on and you got projects like origin you got projects like gold Dow um who else uh there's just a a whole ton of stuff going on okay muen always great to uh get Alpha from six figs and on that note what better way to close this down than with an ICP rally ICP rally can you get me to 19 my zpp rally please be good to me yeah [Music] all right and we're back and I just want

02:51:56	to say you know to William thank you for your wonderful video we're you know out now you know after the music we might as well celebrate uh icp's third birthday so one two three ICP happy birthday I know some of you are going to be in Zurich uh next uh I believe in like 14 days or so 13 days uh it'll be in Switzerland at at uh the definity headquarters for the third annual um anniversary of uh the ICP launch and I did notice that 6figs was in Williams video along with Michelle and I will remind you that six figs has the

02:52:32	cracking FTX documentary coming up later so make sure you're stay tuned for that uh and I just want to say Michelle it was great to see you in the video with William uh love everything that you're doing and you know we're looking forward to hosting more spaces with you um real quick I know that some of you uh have been asking about the air drops and the airdrop codes when they pop up uh they're going to be distributed within the next 48 hours so don't worry about the message you should get you know some

02:52:59	sort of confirmation uh that you qualified for the airdrop but these will be distributed in the next 48 hours they will not be today just so you're aware I wanted to make that very clear um and now we're going to go into a quick testimonial so check that out Hi D my name is Arian I'm the developer of the C++ cdk so I'm also known as icpp Pro but I also love to write MCO I discovered a moto boot camp at the Divinity development forum and uh yeah it's a real boot camp after that boot camp I remember being exhausted but

02:53:35	really understanding how it works to write application for the internet computer and I WR I wrote icgp that you see here let me get it going so I say Joe likes to write stories what this does is it sends this prompt to a moco load balancer and that load balancer is sending this prompt to one of four llms running on the internet computer yes truly this is an application was actually the first one ever that ran an an llm live on the internet computer and this journey for me started with the Moka boot camp so go take it

02:54:12	[Music] all right and we're back and now I want to give a quick shout out we're going to be hearing from Dan ostrovski sorry if I said that wrong Dan I I do love you so I hope I said that right uh but yes we're going to be going to Dan here from nfid and make sure you stay tuned for that because there's going to be more aird drops to come so stay tuned for evalent is a deep in integrated web 3 cloud computing platform empowered by AI foreverin provides developers and projects that decentralized Aton ative to Classic

02:54:49	hosting and Storage Solutions prevalent aims to empower the web three developer communities with distributed efficient lowcost and userfriendly infrastructure to realize these plans we closely work with IC Forin provides decentralization of projects frontend on top of IC also we Empower IC data with global acceleration and accessibility the whole workflow is extremely simple developers can log in sync their GitHub account click on hosting choose IC as a protocol and then deploy the projects on top of

02:55:18	IC in a couple of minutes the project is decentralized frin has already decentralized hundreds of projects and is planning to use ic's computing power to help more apps with decentralized [Music] computation hi I'm Dan I lead the nfid team and I think number one self- sovereignty is critical especially in a world that is losing trust with governments and corporations number two I believe that the future is going to be multi-chain practically speaking how are you going to be self- Sovereign in a

02:55:55	multi-chain world of course you could have a hardware wallet you could have a ledger all the addresses you want a Bitcoin address an eth address an ICP address a salana address cardano address on and on and on the problem is that's a single source of failure so how are you going to travel with that and not feel anxious how are you going to feel secure if you have a billion dollars of assets that have accumulated over many years what happens if someone steals it what happens if someone threatens you

02:56:22	physically and demands that you give up your recovery phrase that single source of failure causes a lot of people anxiety and worse there's said to be about 20% of all Bitcoin that's lost because people have lost their wallets or lost their recovery phases and that's just Bitcoin one network I'm here in ICP because number one you need a smart contract wallet everyone's talked about this and I I believe that's the future a smart contract wallet provides you with with an opportunity to create a customizable multiactor multi- signature

02:56:53	approval policy so how many approvals are necessary in order for you to withdraw some number of Bitcoin or eth or ICP or salano or whatever that also gives you redundancy in case you lose a wallet if you need three approvals but your smart wallet is configured to get three approvals from any of six wallets then you can lose three wallets before you don't have access anymore to this account and it prevents or or rather it protects you from uh physical threat it protects you from wallets that have been

02:57:24	stolen so a lot of protection there and protection against government protection against corporations because when you own a smart contract it's yours forever why an ICP smart contract because that is the only smart contract of any network that exists currently that can hold assets on any network so it can hold your Bitcoin it can hold your eth it can hold your soul it can hold your ICP and whichever other fungible or non-fungible tokens you have together that's what we're building with nfid vaults nfid vaults are our solution to

02:57:57	the question of how will you be self- Sovereign in a multi-chain future and the reason is because every Vault that you create is a smart contract on the internet computer protocol every one of these ICP smart contracts is able to sign transactions using a private key only the network knows about and no one else in the world has access to this private key except for the owner of that smart contract which is you you get to decide how many approvals are necessary in order for this smart contract to

02:58:27	execute a transaction signature using that private key it's not a key that's owned by a government an institution no government can ask a corporation to deny you access to using that key so it is the first ever dentalized multisig for the multi-chain future well if you're a web 3 team if you're or uh Dow or even if you're an individual and you want a higher degree of security for your assets then go to nfid vault.com check out what we offer there for a self- sovereign Omni chain smart contract wallet follow us on X and FID vaults and

02:59:04	send us an email support NF vault.com if you'd like to join our ambassador program and it was great to hear from stand there um and I am receiving some feedback that uh you guys are looking for my personal Twitter X account if you will um so you can follow me at Stafa cap it's a little play on my last name so St f a x e c a p and you could also find that in the bio of the swap um if you go to their swap space account but I'm not trying to steer you all over the place um but yeah uh make sure you're

02:59:43	giving me a follow and even Dan as well um we we have it all set up there or you can just go to our disc Discord and so on um but real quick I do want to you know mention we have a couple more aird drops coming up and I hope you're paying attention because you know they're they're coming up pretty quick we're giving out 100K here uh for a live stream so I hope you're all paying attention and staying glued make sure you're using the pcpcc 2024 hashtag whenever you're posting on socials and let's see more of those memes let's see

03:00:10	what you got and uh yeah let's go into the next uh ad and it looks like it's going to be from gold do so everyone gold out is a rwa real world asset project that tokenize physical goldar into gold token and gold back stable coins gold as one of the most enduring Assets in the world has a long history of value storing and using as a currency however physical goar also face a lot of limitation in terms of Transportation storage ease of use leverage and blockchain Technology we are now creating the most transparent

03:00:48	decentralized way of tokenizing gold gold out has three phases in phase one we are tokenizing physical gold as nft leverage in origin a leading rwa protocol we are creating a digital identity on the blockchain for each of the goldar it's one to one and it's redeemable from the vult in Switzerland phase two using smart contract holders of the gold nft can swap the nft into funable token gldt or the gdt circulating the market are backed by physical go bar and then locked in the smart contract gdt can then be used in

03:01:29	multiple ways as payment as collector borrowing and lending in phase three as one of the biggest potential use case we will create a US dollar stable coin that's backed by JDT this will bring Innovation to the existing stable coin Market is especially who in concern of the Fiat system and risk from the centralized stable coin issuer finally goou is a dow launched on SNS on ICP which is governed by thousands of community members communities get reward by holding staking our governance token GLD go and

03:02:08	participating in proposal voting be part of the goou and let's shape and create the biggest rwa use cases on the blockchain alog together [Music] and we're back so I just want to take a quick moment to mention that tomorrow May 11th at 1500 UTC we will be live with the ICPC SNS Dow so if you do want to participate make sure you're you know planning accordingly and and timing that properly um we are also about to hear from Moko boot camp graduate Roy so let's get into that the most recent addition to the

03:03:02	geek family is uh VP geek VP here stands for voting power so it's a voting power dashboard you can use VP geek to find yourself a perfect neurons to follow so you can do that by checking how much have they staked what is their voting power what is their voting particip ation rate how exactly they voted on each proposal when they usually vote in the beginning of the proposal or when other neurons have voted already and so on and so forth BP geek has a lot of analytics and charts about ICP governance so please give it a

03:03:32	[Music] try hello my name is Roy I mainly a Russian python developer I discover the boot camp while looking for places hangout in Lisbon the bot Camp was very interesting I liked how it was organized and the combination of the written material and SS live streams made for a very comprehensive loan and environment for my project I wanted to see if it was possible to write a letter to solution for ethereum that would have zero gas fees both when swapping ethereum for layer to tokens and when spending

03:04:10	transactions the idea was to make a cash back system that would pass all the fees onto the receiver of the transaction kind of like credit cards work I used chain key cryptography to generate a private public key pair that would be Associated only through the canister and then use HTTP out calls to periodically scan and send ethereum transactions if you're interested in crypto and like P gaming I'm sure you will enjoy the boot camp [Music] all right I just got confirmation from pcpcc Team there's going to be a 10 ICP

03:05:03	uh airdrop uh to whoever makes the best meme for the ICP CC 2024 uh and when you're doing that make sure you're putting the # ICP cc24 2024 and tagging the ICP orcc account on Twitter uh that way you can enter the contest sorry getting a call here um but yeah so now we're going to see a quick uh ad from yuku um and now with that yeah with yuku uh the virtual metaverse that we're you know partnered with today uh they've been doing a live stream for everyone uh to to enjoy while we're online sorry call was going through

03:05:42	someone got me um and uh now we'll also have uh another influence her SWAT come in and we're going to hear from coin nation very soon so let's go to that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey guys thanks for tuning in to my segment of the one and only ipcc 2024 conference I was very excited when I was asked to contribute to the conference again my name is Preston I'm with the coin Nation YouTube channel and I'm a huge advocate of the internet computer protocol I typically put out content that looks at the internet

03:07:12	computer from a technical standpoint because at the end of the day I believe it's the superior technology found in the internet computer protocol that will lead to a future of promise for the project also if you're anything like me you're wondering how does ICP stack up against other platforms that also claim to enable web 3 application development without the centralized Cloud dependencies these typically come in the form of general purpose compute dpin projects some examples are cud window within the cosmos IBC ecosystem you may

03:07:52	also be aware of a left. im which aims to be blockchain agnostic and with decentralized Cloud being a relatively new paradigm finding deep technical comparisons is a challenging ordeal especially given that these networks and Protocols are still very actively under development like myself many of you are probably of the opinion that the internet computer protocol is the most advanced blockchain in existence maybe it's the notion of blockchain Singularity or maybe it's Utopia or cross-chain communication via chain key

03:08:28	cryptography that speaks to you I think ICP hits so many narratives because it is the only project that appears to be aiming at what we all want in the way that you'd expect a top tier web 3 protocol to achieve it as a developer myself learning about ethereum got me excited because immediately became clear that the idea was to swap out your backend components for this notion of a world computer right it only takes a few minutes though to realize that smart contracts on eth would never replace a

03:09:00	lightning fast database an application server cloud storage and scalable computation that's when you begin to realize that you will still need a centralized Cloud for a decentralized application which kind of defeats the purpose of a decentralized application of some reason it takes a while to connect the dots and see the irony of most blockchain technology I believe however that people are waking up probably the most telling of that is the fact that the definity and the ICP Community Buzz words and in some case

03:09:33	even the strategies have literally been hijacked by competing projects and one of the most notable being the AO messaging protocol built on top of the r weave blockchain and this brings me to the primary topic of this this video verifiable computation digging into some of the claims by R weave has led me to believe that the internet computer excels in the area of verifiable computation this is the aspect of decentralized cloud that all other such platforms will have to Grapple with in one way or another as with ICP AO on R

03:10:10	we is a highly ambitious project and in this video I will present some reasons why I believe that the issue of verifiable comp reputation is where not only AO but most other deepend compute projects either fall short or have yet to solve this problem so guys if this is something that interests you I know it does it's why you're here then buckle up get some popcorn get a nice drink and let's get into [Music] it welcome back welcome back we are talking about verifiable computation and why ICP chose the right approach just

03:10:52	giv a little background one of the most important elements of blockchain technology is the concept of verification it's the whole notion of blockchain nodes arriving at consensus not trying to get extremely technical here but the idea is it's virtually impossible for nodes to reach consensus and there be something malicious about the results that they arrive consensus on so basically to reach consensus means we can trust what we are about to add to the blockchain right and that goes across the board for the majority of

03:11:26	blockchain tech regardless of the consensus mechanism so Point number one is the centralization the centralization of the internet and the need for data privacy has led to the emergence of decentralized cloud Solutions So within Cloud you have three big players that kind of monopolize the space you have your Microsoft azure you have Google cloud provider and then you have the big boy Amazon web services back in 2020 or somewhere in that era there was a deplatforming event where a social media network was completely taken offline by

03:12:01	AWS Amazon web services and many people such as myself thought we would never see the day where that would take place ladies and gentlemen that is a direct product of the monopolization era that we live in of big Tech they can literally take you offline and it's not a joke right so what we see happening in digital assets right now is the emergence of something called decentralized physical infrastructure there are no middlemen there's the resource desired and then there is the technology that can decentralize the

03:12:33	procurement of said resource and the incentivization of that person to provide the resource right or the entity to provide the resource are the cryptocurrency assets that they could easily accumulate in doing so right so you have tokens in exchange for the providing access to resources and you know there's a huge Market that I believe exists and the more people learn that there are alternatives to centralized technology the more I believe dpin Solutions are going to be sought after and utilized so now that we

03:13:10	know the reason for the emergence of decentralized cloud Solutions Point number two says a primary technical challenge of dpen cloud projects is the need to verify computational results this is sounds a lot more complicated than it is in nutshell um let's take artificial intelligence a lot of processing taking place lot of storage requirements right now the majority of AI use cases rely on centralized Cloud there really is no way to verify that the data you're getting back from the cloud can be trusted so the way that

03:13:44	this takes place now is I'm going to send off computational tasks to to multiple Cloud providers so I may send the same task to Google same task to Microsoft same task to Amazon and if I get the same result back from all three I'll consider that a trustworthy outcome right to computational effort of those tasks this is both time consuming it's also costly to duplicate the work you know it's it's one of those uh things where you can kind of tell it's The Growing Pains of a new emerging Tech so uh and again I put here the challenges

03:14:16	due to ad Mir perod of use cases that require the Outsourcing of complex tasks to Cloud servers for computation and the last point I have here is is in the traditional Arena just like I just said uh this problem is typically solved by sending your tasks to multiple platforms and then juxtaposing the results don't worry we're going to get to some juicy juicy stuff soon so uh but being that what we're after here right are the benefits of decentralized clouds such as security and data privacy we need a

03:14:53	decentralized way to verify computational results Q in ICP being a front runner and decentralized Cloud compute ICP has chosen to solve this problem via replication and consensus most ICP alternative networks have chosen a path derived from typical proof of stake consensus mechanism which resort to penalized nodes in which Foul Play is detected so if you look at uh ethereum just had a huge upgrade and they went from proof of work proof of State basically what that is you have validators that validate transactions

03:15:31	and in the event anything malicious is detected amongst such validators the capital that they have staked or locked into the protocol will be slashed meaning some of their hard-earned Capital will be removed never to return back into their hands if their nodes are not on the up and up so this is the route this same kind of staking Paradigm that's the route that most of the networks other than ICP have chosen to go down and as we'll talk about a little bit throughout this video there are many issues with that route when you're

03:16:08	talking about decentralized physical infrastructure terms of cloud in terms of compute a lot of issues with going the staking route so let's dig a little bit into verification on the internet computer protocol icp's consistence mechanism is based on replication and consensus requiring at least 2/3 of the network nodes to agree on a transaction before it can be added to the chain so here's an example on ICP a subnet that has 100 nodes or what they also refer to as replicas would progress uninterrupted

03:16:41	as long as at least 66 of the nodes are in alignment when you think no think replica when you think replica think just a machine and they're all progressing in the same manner however many nodes exist on the subnet are all progressing in the same manner so number three we have if any replica is reported as either tampered with or has connection issues or worst case deemed malicious this will not make a difference to the majority meaning subnet continues chugging along no issue all sensitive computation can be ran

03:17:15	through icp's novel consensus mechanism to ensure trustworthy results number five we have icp's consensus mechanism allows both the input and the output data of canister which is also considered like a smart contract on ICP software to be trustworthy that's the key thing here if it pumps out of the consensus within the ICP on the other side and the nodes arrive at consensus you can trust the data that comes out on the other side and I put this as crucial to the use cases such as AI computational results that have been

03:17:55	Outsource in the centralized Cloud Arena you either just trust the computation of the platform such as AWS or Google cloud or you duplicate the workload on other platforms for verification definity has determined that the most logical path to don't trust but verify with regard to computation is to bundle it with consensus and that's probably the prettiest way to put why the internet computer is so powerful you're are bundling the outsourced computation results along with the consensus mechanism right and if it makes it

03:18:36	through you are 100% able to trust that you have accurate verified computational result so now we're going to talk a little bit about verification on AO so just a little background AO is a cloud compute or messaging protocol that builds on top of the r weave storage based blockchain AO uses entities called compute units to process data that has been persisted to R weave it stores the results on R weave as well right so you have some data that you want to run through computation you persist that on

03:19:10	our weave then the compute unit shows up picks off that data does some processing and then the result is also precis assisted back to rwe rwe relies on node operator staking in order to penalize problematic or malicious nodes number four by separating compute from consensus AO claims to have unbounded computational capability without any blockchain related constraints this is the direct shot at ICP because the claim is the very thing that I just praised ICP for which is the bundling of you know computation with consensus they're

03:19:44	saying you know creates all of these issues in terms of performance so now you have the Battle of tradeoffs right you have internet computer making tradeoffs so that we can trust the data and as you'll see in a second you have R weave making tradeoffs to try to scale performance infinitely but you're missing probably the most crucial components of security and verifiability that makes all of this worth your while in the first place so number five we have however ao's architecture combined with no provider staking presents any

03:20:17	issues in the arena of compute verification since computational results are persisted on our weave before any verification here's a question how can you trust this output as valid input for a subsequent process right so remember you're dealing with ICP If you have a canister which is what we all have to work with to do anything on the internet computer you send data to a canister processes it and before anything is added to the chain you have a consensus you have replicas all the doing the same

03:20:47	thing coming up with the same outcome once we confirm everything checks out across nodes add to the chain flip to our weaves approach you just add to the chain that's it you perform your computation and then you just add to the chain zero verification so yeah how can you trust this output as valid for any postprocessing so the first question I asked was how can you trust the output as valid input for a subsequent process which is probably the more scary situation because you have process a grab some data off chain for on our

03:21:19	relief processes it produces bad results maybe it's a bug maybe something malicious something something's going on there tampered with and now process B picks it up and it's acting in good faith because the only thing that process B looks at hey was it added on chain and then it goes forward and just uses the bad data to continue its processing so ditching consensus is what creates this problem in terms of AO the computer so my last Point here is the AO team has attempted to suggest that the way to deal with this the way to solve

03:21:52	this is to scale up the number of compute units that process the same job and that that would be adequate for verification but but the issue is they ditch the consensus and that's problematic for a number of reasons so we're going to talk a little bit about some of those reasons for instance if a process has already received bad input from a faulty nodes outcome how do you handle this in such a flexible cuz they're they're priding themselves on such a just crazy amount of flexibility right well what happens when you do

03:22:22	encounter a faulty node now we're talking about hypers scalability asynchronous everything paralleled they you know throwing out all these wonderful buzzword that make you think that AO is is just solved everything well what do you do in this scenario uh the answer is that the architecture creates a situation where it cannot be immediately clear that the compute unit inputs can be trusted from other processes because this is a completely permissionless environment anyone can show up plug in their compute resources

03:22:55	and stake some some coin and now they're a node on AO so how do you know that the input to the compute units can be trusted without consensus so the scenario could be remedy via and and I got this from the from the ICP developer Forum a very very if if you get a chance check out the thread from last last JMS I believe his name is a lot of good definity developers a lot of good activity on that Forum but um one gentleman discusses how AO may solve this problem and it's not pretty the scenario could be remedied via an

03:23:30	optimistic verification mechanism now when we say optimistic think optimistic layer twos right such as uh arbitrum where staking and slashing is utilized every time I think about optimism regarding ethereum I get a migraine because I remember the first time I tried to move some funds off of arbitrum and it was talking about a 7day weight period or something like that so this is the kind of stuff we're dealing with if you want to ditch consensus so number 12 we have many questions remain for verification and cross chain

03:24:00	communication with regards to how AO would Implement optimistic challenging plus staking and plus slashing so the idea here is when you encounter a malicious node or a buggy node or something you'd have to have a means by which you're going to challenge the results of that node and then you have to have a a process to slash the staking uh funds of the node so you know not sure if you're Connecting the Dots here but all of that so-called scalability is going out the window if you encounter one single issue with a node because now

03:24:36	you're going through this optimistic process that could take God knows how long anyway uh so I I put some some questions here that still remain to be seen in terms of ao's solution question number one who would initiate the challenge to the computational results question number two how much of an effort will it take to fully verify the computation of a single transaction how would a roll back take place if a compute unit is deemed to produce invalid results right and question number four is optimistic verification

03:25:09	even practical in unbounded they keep using that kind of word unbounded virtual machine async setting so guys the the goal here was not to get like crazy crazy technical or anything like that although we kind of did but the goal here is to say when you have crypto's most capable research and development team that's been trying to solve the problem of giving an alternative to the traditional technology stack of the worldwide web and they've been at it for over 2 years now right probably 3 years not sure um

03:25:43	someone comes along and says hey we figured this thing out in in a couple of months you ought to throw some red flags there that that's kind of all I'm saying right um but in conclusion first of all thank you for bearing with me I just feel like this is something important for the internet computer Community to know and to not be spooked from being not just an investor but a Believer and what I believe is the best effort to truly bring in the vision of web 3 you know and that's one of the main reasons

03:26:13	that I'm a supporter of the internet computer protocol because I don't see any other project trying to realize that Vision in a very meaningful way right because right now I mean what are we stuck with we're stuck with a whole bunch of layer ones that have made things faster transactions faster um new bells and whistles but for the most part the underlying technology has not made much more strides beyond that of ethereum here we have a conclusion here icp's blockchain Singularity approach places data accuracy security and fault

03:26:46	talk tolerance at the Forefront of priority and definity still remains in a league of its own in attempting to bundle computation along with consensus and number three despite claims of rivaling projects computation verification Remains the Achilles heel of all attempts at unbounded computation and in the context of verifiable compute only ICP provides adequate assurance that incoming messages can be trusted from previous processes this is crucial to modernday use cases but anyway guys so there are

03:27:22	alternatives right to layer ones on centralized Cloud right and and I mentioned some of these earlier for instance you could create a decentralized application leveraging solely ethereum and something like a left out IM or Kudos there are all Alternatives out there that can be done in a decentralized manner however you're still bumping up against state-based protocols so in terms of compute verification back in the same boat in my personal opinion you're in the right project because where some may paint

03:27:54	them as shortcomings I look at them as technical hurdles in trying to do what has never been done before and what I've seen is a commitment by definity especially given the the latest road map that they rolled out I mean they are aggressively trying to tackle any hurdles that come up on the mission to create what is in my opinion the first True World computer so I just want to say thank you guys for tuning in if you made it this far again I'm Preston with coin Nation you can check me out on Twitter X whatever coin Nation HQ

03:28:28	YouTube coin Nation IP and on the web you can check me out at www. coin.io and until I see you again peace [Music] all right we're back and I hope you caught that airdrop there and great video from coin Nation I got to be honest coin nation that was the first time I saw your videos and it looks fabulous I was just watching it on TV here um but shout out to you for creating content around the IC uh definitely looks very uh high-end with the production level and you know effort that you put in so I really appreciate

03:29:17	you taking the time to be here with us today um I do also have another influencer that we're about to highlight so stay tuned we're about to hear from Aaron Bremer who's definitely an OG we got to meet him in Bitcoin Miami last year uh with William and Michelle so it was great to meet Aaron officially and now we're going to hear from him on his content for the pcpcc welcome to relation the decentralized social graph protocol relation ID the multi-chain identity with princip ownership validated in ICP redefines and stores

03:30:26	every bond is a story waiting to be told hey what's up ICP Community it's Aaron here and as you guys know I do a lot in the crypto space but today in my talk I'm going to be talking about what I'm doing in the ICP ecosystem currently as I'm recording this video it is currently April 3rd so everything I'm saying is of that time and you know a lot of development is going to be happening with the projects I'm talking about right here um from the time that I'm recording this and the time that you see it so right now I currently advise

03:31:03	three projects in the ICP ecosystem the magic Kong shell MCS um alpaca labs and Noble blocks so in my talk I'm going to be talking about all three of these projects and why I think they will be the three biggest projects to come out of the ICP ecosystem so first we have MCS um MCS the founder of MCS is Matias uh some of you guys may or may not know who he is um he may or may not be talking in this uh conference after me we'll see but MCS is an amazing amazing project so right now Matias is working

03:31:41	on something called MC scan now take a look at this right here this is absolutely insane this is what is going to be the Dex tools of the ICP ecosystem as you can see here you're going to be able to trade and everything take a look at this right here and you're actually going to be able to trade on all three dexes going to be three main dexes Sonic ICP Swap and IC Lighthouse now of course at the time of the recording that is the plan the plans from when I recorded this and when you're actually seeing this

03:32:10	could have changed but that's uh currently the plan so what you're seeing right now on your screen is a sneak peek of MC scan now of course right now in the ICP Community there is a lack a severe lack of trading Tools in Magic Kong shell the MCS team which is matius a couple developers and then I'm advising that's the team currently um you know they're they are building out the tools to you know help fill that Gap in the ICP ecosystem there's going to be some really really amazing things to come from MC scan this thing is going to

03:32:43	be absolutely huge it's going to be every ICP Traders wet dream that's exactly what it's going to be I think it's going to be absolutely inane now I was actually you know I came on to this project very very early what happened was in my telegram um you know people started talking about this thing called MCS MCS I'm like what the hell is this you know what's going on um and then I reach out to Matias and this was before people knew that Matias was actually developing um some awesome Tech they thought it was

03:33:13	just another meme coin but I looked at the website and I saw wait a minute this is not just another meme coin this is an extremely valuable high-tech company um this thing has tons and tons and tons of potential Matias and the team are absolutely killing it and I think when it comes to defi trading and all that stuff MCS is going to play a massive role and it's going to be an absolute Cornerstone in that department so I've been working with these guys for you know a super super long time now it's

03:33:45	been a really awesome ride so far and there's a lot to come this thing is just getting started so absolutely incredible MC scan as you're watching this should be coming out soon and be prepared the next project we're going to talk about is alpaca Labs so alpaca Labs is absolutely awesome this project was actually born in my telegram at first you know people thought it was just a meme coin but I knew that Sebastian the uh the main devb AKA Seb I knew that he was doing something much much bigger when Seb initially released the alpaca

03:34:18	token which was a completely Fair launch also MCS was also a completely Fair launch as well I'd like to add that as well um when Sebastian launched a token he also launched it with a bot in my telegram so immediately out the gate Sebastian released some technology for people to come play around with and at the time of this recording we have just released the alac AI app uh for Apple and Android and we have just just released it yesterday at the time of this recording this thing is going to be the coin market cap of ICP and they're

03:34:53	also by the time you're watching this there could also be some other very very cool things coming down the line the team is absolutely Relentless Sebastian and long the two developers at the time of this recording are absolute Savages these guys just do not stop working at all really cool stuff as you can see you can get Al alpaca ICP listings on Android Google Play and you can get it on the app store now the way Sebastian got this idea so initially Sebastian released the the telegram bot and then

03:35:22	he released a Dap and then he decided hey let's make a mobile app and the way this actually was started was you know same similar to the magic Kong shell you know Sebastian similar to meas you know they're able to spot gaps in the market and really I think it's a pretty obvious I think a lot of us you know can agree on this and especially in my telegram which is basically you know a you know it's a very large part of the ICP Community my telegram at the time is recording as over 800 people so we are a

03:35:51	solid solid chunk of the ICP community so you're able you know developers are able to come into the telegram and really see hey what are people saying what needs to be done in this ecosystem to improve and you know one of the main things that you know Sebastian saw and that I saw and everyone pretty much saw I think the telegram was just a matter of time before someone does it is that checking you know the charts for ICP coins is actually you know extremely difficult you know it's you know you got

03:36:17	to go to some website at you know before alpaca fi came out it was really hard it was annoying you had to go on there you had to you know click a bunch of tabs and it was all confusing and now with Al Paca you can just open your phone check the prices of all your favorite ICP token coins and there's also a lot more you know Sebastian you know he's constantly putting out updates him and the developer long are just you know it's Sebastian and long they're both the devs they're going absolutely insane they're constantly working really

03:36:46	big stuff coming from alpaca Labs uh alpaca f app this one is for sure a winner um these guys are absolute you know killer so both of these projects MCS and alpaca labs are really spearheading you know filling that Gap in the trading SL defi ecosystem of ICP um yeah really cool stuff I think both these projects have extreme extreme amounts of potential when you talk about crypto as a whole you know objectively the most money right now is in def5 and right now uh icp's weakest point is that but that's why MCS and alpaca fi and

03:37:23	alpaca labs are coming along because you know let's make you know ICP trading and defi great and these two projects are going to help solve that so really awesome stuff definitely go check these two out MCS IP on Twitter and alpaca unor Labs on Twitter absolutely amazing projects now let's talk about the last project I'm advising right now Noble block so Nova blocks is the first di project ever to be built 100% on the blockchain it's built fully on the internet computer now the token was released on you know the erc20 standard

03:38:01	which is you know ethereum standard but there is you know at the time of this recording there is plans for a chain key Noble to be created which would make Noble blocks the first project ever to utilize the chain key erc20 token um you know the C CK rc20 abilities so I think this is a super super cool project I think dii has an amazing narrative for crypto in general and um you know when you take a look at the US United United States uh GDP 15% of the US's GDP is in healthcare which is trillions and

03:38:34	trillions of dollars so if this sector of crypto decentralized science can just get a small smidge of that those trillions of dollars then it's going to be worth a lot of money okay and take a look at this this is the uh UI for Noble blocks NOA blocks is using blockchain will address the profound imbalances in the academic publishing industry you know and basically in the Science World there is a lot of you know barriers entries for scientists and everything Noble blocks is lowering the barrier and also making

03:39:06	things much more transparent by utilizing the internet computer protocol and those are the three project projects that I have been advising slash incubating and I think they are all three humongous winners absolutely amazing teams developers are amazing great Brands to go along with that as well um nobody stopping these three projects I'm super excited and yeah I appreciate you guys if you guys are interested in following me I'm Aaron bremore onx and thank you for coding state for allowing me to do this and

03:39:36	everything and see you guys on Twitter or Telegram orever [Music] all right I hope you caught that ghost air drop right there make sure you're punching in those codes uh rewards will be distributed for the air drops within 48 hours so just a reminder that's what you can look for um it was great to hear from Aaron Brer there I did catch the tail end so I'm talking about Noble blocks which which is a great dsai project um now I'd like to also mention that we've already hit over 5,000 live viewers which is a record so make sure

03:40:25	you're continuing to reshare the stream I've been seeing tons of great memes on the hash ipcc 2024 so keep doing those memes and tag ipor CC we're going to do that 10 iccp Challenge and we'll have the winner selected and uh ICP CC team will uh actually distribute the rewards for that so just wanted to remind you all we'll keep doing some reminders I've seen some great memes uh the honey tie me up that was really funny I retweeted that from the swap so uh let's uh keep the memes flowing the energy going keep sharing

03:40:58	the streams and uh let's get over to this Mako boot camp testimonial hi everyone I'm VI and I'm excited to share my journey with ipcc first of all IED about this Moto boot camp to a random podcast in YouTube with s and blockchain Bill and it got me curious about IC and its potential they discovered about some sweet job opportunities so I heard he is conducting a moto boot camp I thought of it's a good opportunity to learn even though I haven't built any projects that I can showcase yet but my experience

03:41:34	with Moto boot camp was super cool I have gained solid understanding of moto and this applications I'm currently brainstorming ideas for my project in d space on IC and I'm passionate about creating innovative ideas that can benefit the community so if you are interested like me be sure to check out Moto boot [Music] camp all right and now we're back and I just want to give you a quick reminder that tomorrow May 11th we will have the pcpcc SNS Dow available at 1500 UTC and real quick I would also like to take the

03:42:17	time to remind you to follow ipcc on Twitter and join the telegram so you can find it best there from the Twitter page uh and also I'd like to take a moment to thank our sponsor cataly we're about to hear from Ray real quick here uh Ry is I think the first person that we've had on the swap space three times so shout out to Ry he's a legend really love what catalyze is doing and let's go into his video hello everybody I'm Valentina C of SE trade did you know that for a company in Latin America to compensate their

03:42:52	carbon footprint is actually quite difficult so what we're trying to do is to open up a marketplace where we can sell tokenized climate assets we are tokenizing these Assets in the IP blockchain not only because it's highly efficient and developer friendly but also because it's one of the cleanest blockchains that there are so it's perfect for clean tech like ours we have just been awarded the most innovative startup in our batch in startup Chile and also we are on our way to becoming the first Latin American platform

03:43:21	operator in the IR Foundation organization which is really just such a cool thing so if you want to know more about us just go to zot trade. thank you very [Music] much we found analyzing uh the community space over the last four years that most web three communities were really audiences and the engagement level was relatively minimal as long as the market was going up and air drops were happening discords and telegrams were blowing up and the real indication of a community versus an audience is what

03:44:00	happens when the house lights go up the audience leaves you as soon as the performance stops a community keeps talking and interacting when you're not there so how many Community managers out there know that if they stop hitting their Discord 14 hours a day their discord's going to die that's not a community that's an audience and you are the performer and so we've built an economic system around catalyze and a tooling set that allows the community to take ownership of it have a vested interest in it and then be economically

03:44:27	rewarded for it as a community manager we have a tokenomics model that's align to your growth metrics so as you grow you get rewarded for growth on the platform and by combining both of those elements for the community manager and for the community participant we built a very symbiontic model that will convert your audience audence which you're maintaining on other platforms into a community that will grow and continue to grow with hopefully less and less handholding by the original creators catalyze has a familiar looking feel so

03:44:57	if you know Discord or telegram the channel models of Discord in particular text channels audio channels where we are different besides being on on web 3 is we have an events engine in the platform when you manage a community a lot of what you do is organized around an event or an activity you have an air drop you have an AMA you want to do there's some news item a partnership you want to do you might be running a campaign or you know sometime have giveaway these are all event types so for example in a traditional web 2 model

03:45:28	you would create an event using some event tool maybe you put on a shared Google Calendar you'd have to go tell people on telegram Discord Twitter Flack WhatsApp that you're doing this thing and then maybe have to run it multiple times on those different platforms to get engagement I'm catalyzed you can do all of that in one location have a group you can create an audio channel for your Ama or your spaces you can invite people to it so they can register you can conduct the session live on the platform

03:45:57	and then during this live session you can whitelist people who are attending that session and then airdrop to them you know whatever promotional materials you want nfts meme coins regular tokens and you do all of that within a closed container you're not using four or five different applications you can iMed immediately reward people for Behavior there's no more hey thanks for attending the Twitter space send us your principal or your wallet ID and at some point in four or five days we're going to send

03:46:25	you something you can literally reward them as it's happening and if we know anything about web 3 it's immediacy people want instant gratification they want to know what they did mattered and lag time kills communities catalyze is backwards compatible with all the platforms I mentioned Discord telegram WhatsApp slack so you can actually post this information advertise these events in channel on catalyze and it will replicate real time to all those other platforms go to catalyze do1 uh read about the platform and then log in set

03:46:59	up an account set up a community that's really easy to do build out your profile in addition you can find this in catalyze one1 on Twitter best place to get intimate answers to questions and to talk to the team is in the catalyze user Community I'm there a lot so you can ask me a question you can DM me uh we answer our own phones and we're happy to hear about what you think what you like what you don't like ideas Partnerships um that's probably the best place to do it you also can contact us via email at

03:47:27	Social catalyze do1 [Music] [Music] all right and we just heard from Ry there again Ry is building catalyze and we just saw the catalyze airdrop so make sure you're typing in that code I believe it's on ICP ccc.com uh and they can get a link to you in the telegram or on uh Twitter here again to remind you where to submit your codes um and now we're going to go into um a quick testimonial from another MCO boot Camp graduate so let's do that hey what's up guys my name is Roland and I'm a web developer since

03:48:25	more than 20 years I have been involved in ic ecosystem since the again this event in May 2021 I'm also a two-time OKO boot camp finisher and I really loved their experience since the end of the last year I have time and possibility to develop a project entirely on the internet computer the Project Blog IC academy. gradually answers the question what does it really mean to run a business application directly on the internet computer for developers it is best practice example to guide them in their transition from a web two to a web

03:49:07	3 developer now you know something more about me at my work see you maybe at the next Moko book Bo can user geek you can think of it as a simple version of mix panel or amplitude but it's 100% on chain so if you want to build on the internet computer or already have a working product and you don't want to compromise your user privacy by sending their data to Google analytics please check user geek then we have a config which is like a Google Firebase remote config tool but again it's written in motco and it's hosted

03:49:53	100% on the internet computer it allows uh you to configure your product adjust some settings run some product experiments and all in real time canister geek is where you can monitor your Cycles you can see historical charts and you can see prediction of when certain canister will run out of Cycles you can top up your canisters directly on canister geek and have full Financial reports on your spending on each [Music] canister hybd is the ICP layer to Dex and Next Generation crypto exchange that

03:50:32	can not only achieve safety decentralization and scalability simultaneously but also customized and userfriendly to Young users and even gen Z our hybrid team use our propriety technology to achieve over 1 million transaction per second TPS without sacrificing decentralization and safety and we Leverage The chaining technology of ICP to achieve Omni chain compatibility more importantly we are the Robin Hood in the digital assets and we can serve as a bridge between web two and web 3 w hey guys my name is Emilio canessa I'm

03:51:23	the head of global adoption at definity Foundation my team and I have designed and implemented the uh Global highp hubs program we Define this as a regional Catalyst a hub is organized with a few what we call co-founders which have the responsibility of bringing forward the operations and developing The Hub and taking care of the growth ICP hubs are not a solo Mission or one or two person Mission these are very open places what does a hub do there is specific range of activities which are organized in

03:51:56	something we call the adoption funnel that starts from evangelism passing through education incubation few ICP hubs now are in that phase where there's incubation of of projects going on second very important aspect these are regionalized operation web3 is a lot about communities imagine the difference in activities and strategies and things that happen concerning with three in places such as Korea or India or Italy or Kenya or us or Argentina cannot be the same the region is mostly in charge of what to do the Hub leadership and

03:52:34	Entourage ped it up and decide on how to do the program is still uh supported through grants from the uh definity foundation so on our side uh internally we provide guidance and it's way more independent and way more decentralized than any other such operation in web 3 one of the main thing we're seeing happening now is ICP hubs becoming a real bridge between the U internet computer community and the stakeholders developers even from other chain for example first of all it's worth mentioning that the whole operation runs

03:53:09	on open chat which is a decentralized messaging application entirely running on chain on the internet computer the best place to get in touch with IB hubs is Twitter there is a aggregated handle at ICP hubs where you'll find in the description the link tree of all other hubs Twitter handle and that's probably the easiest way to get in touch with IP hubs thank you very much [Music] [Music] my name is Samuel AKA Sam the the and I'm a graduate from the Moto boot camp organized by codan state I graduated in

03:54:05	May 2023 and how I discovered about the Boot Camp or through one of the WhatsApp groups which I'm a member of I just saw the link registered and R and the rest is history so aside from the boot camps I've worked on a couple of different projects within the ICP ecosystem but currently one of the projects that I'm working on is this application called IC connect so basically this application allows you to post your content across the different platforms within the ICP ecosystem with one click currently we

03:54:33	are targeting platforms like discover platforms like open chat and also tager so I started this project of recent but you have already connected taga to this application meaning you can just you know shed your content and post it on account right from this application so I'm calling upon everyone that has not attended the Moto boot camp please try it out attend enroll and then the experience will be awesome welcome to amolad the play and their MMO RPG Adventure you've been waiting for our core idea is simple yet

03:55:12	ambitious to create a high quality social realtime MMO RPG with stunning visuals immersive gameplay and a competitive environment while making all assets valuable within the amolad world H we've developed our own staking mechanism Marketplace and asset Explorer amolad is 100% on chain and everything happens right in your browser thanks to icp's technology our first Milestone is the release of our multiplayer version we have exciting plans to integrate multi-chain capabilities enhance the value of eold and expand our presence on

03:55:45	decentralized exchanges we're dedicated to bringing you the best gaming experience [Music] possible web 3 is the future but it's still much harder to use than web 2 the industry is fragmented across many blockchains forcing web3 Builders to choose between difficult compromises in centralization versus usability these compromises were only necessary because web 3 was incomplete in May 2021 this all changed with the launch of the internet computer protocol or ICP ICP is a decentralized cloud that

03:56:24	Bridges the gap between web 2 and web 3 to create ICP over 100 cryptographers worked for eight years to perfect an utterly new cryptography Innovation it's called chainkey technology but before we explain how it works let's quickly look at the incredible things ICP can do do first let's explore how decentralized applications on ICP can pair with web 2 applications ICP has a powerful new type of smart contract called canisters they are decentralized web servers that can directly host full websites with low

03:57:03	latency canisters can store up to 400 gab of data perform complex calculations and connect to web to services and apis without oracles users don't pay gas on ICP when canisters do computations they burn a token called Cycles from a built-in wallet this process is called a reverse gas model gas costs on ICP usually get paid by the core teams or Dows that own the canisters but some daps collect assets to cover their gas costs themselves the Cycles needed to run canisters can only be minted by burning

03:57:42	ICP tokens and the mint ratio gets stabilized against the real world costs of running the physical nodes that are doing the computation the cost of Hosting daps on ICP is consistent and inexpensive regardless of whether the price of ICP tokens goes up or down the result is that canisters can deliver decentralized web experiences that look and feel indistinguishable from web 2 next let's look into how ICP connects with the web 3 world most web 3 blockchains require Bridges to connect to other chains bridges are built by

03:58:20	deploying smart contracts on each chain and relaying transactions between them relaying transactions across chains often involves expensive cryptography computation multisig wallets between trusted parties and offchain oracles the complicated architecture of web3 bridges makes them slow costly difficult to use and prone to security breaches ICP canisters can directly sign transactions on other blockchains such as Bitcoin and ethereum without Bridges or centralized service providers canisters can mint ordinals on bitcoin

03:58:58	deploy smart contracts on ethereum and do anything a human user can do across different web 3 blockchains effectively making them decentralized autonomous web 3 users the result is that ICP can abstract away the complexity of multi-chain trans actions so that users can enjoy a seamless web 3 experience chain key technology the alien Tech powering ICP makes these incredible capabilities possible to understand chain key let's review how typical web 3 secret Keys work when a web 3 user wants to create a new blockchain transaction

03:59:35	they sign a message to the blockchain using a secret key that only they know a threshold signature is when one secret key gets broken up into pieces held by different nodes in a network together these nodes can collectively sign messages without ever revealing the entire secret key to any node in the network governments and militaries have been using threshold cryptography to protect their most valuable Secrets since the 9s however these organizations only execute threshold signatures within controlled private networks blockchain

04:00:11	networks must be public trustless and decentral ized web 3 nodes might be offline or malicious and an attacker might even try to collect the pieces of the secret key over time secure threshold signatures on web 3 were impossible until the definity foundation invented chain key technology with chain key up to 1/3 of nodes could be offline or malicious and the network can still generate a secure signature the pieces of the secret key stored on each node are also constantly scrambling so that any information leaked from a node is

04:00:48	useless to attackers this makes it possible to create a decentralized network that can use secret Keys No human or computer will ever know definity built ICP on top of chain key technology to completely reimagine what an L1 blockchain could be with the vision of creating a fully decentralized internet for example anyone can verify the content received from the internet computer by simply validating a signature without sinking the entire blockchain in addition 0% of ICP nodes run on AWS or other big Tech Cloud

04:01:24	providers ICP nodes are themselves independent private clouds running in data centers all over the world furthermore nodes on ICP only act as vendors for an onchain Dow that manages an ICP Network called the network nervous system or nns ICP holders who stake tokens in the nns are the only ones who can control the source code of the network and they can collectively update the network without hard Forks ICP is entirely alien to anything else within web 2 or web 3 which makes it perfect for connecting the two in ways

04:02:01	never possible before with Bitcoin Humanity got the first decentralized network with ethereum Humanity got the first decentralized logic with ICP Humanity now has the first de centralized secret Keys the first decentralized cloud and the first decentralized AI models oh yeah did we mention that ICP is the only blockchain that can fully host AI models on chain now that is alien Tech the future of the internet belongs to everyone and it won't be harder to use whatever blockchains you love and whatever web 3

04:02:37	future you're fighting for icp's alien Tech will be a part of it explore what ICP has to offer and take your place in the web 3 [Music] Invasion all right we are back and I hope you caught that airdrop uh a lot of exciting things going on in the IC currently we just saw alelo talk about the ICP hubs which is a great initiative helping Builders and community members uh you know help spread awareness about IC um but I also want to take a moment to remind you uh we've already hit over 5,000 viewers and let's keep sharing

04:03:23	that link and while you're watching make sure you're subscribing to our YouTube channel so hit that subscribe real quick um and you know before we get into our next guest um I do want to remind you that we're going to have Jesse Williams here from personal Dow who is going to be one of the videos you see next and we also have Laura Cole who was at last year's ipcc as a speaker and we get to welcome her back as well so let's get into those banking crisis currently unfolding has resulted in The Disappearance of Community Banks leaving

04:03:55	a void and Community finance options personal Dow leverages the internet computer protocol to facilitate financing for communities in a way that allows communities to maintain 100% sovereignty of their funds personal da is a gated Dow that is designed such that each Community has has their own unique personal da deployed to the internet each personal da is its own entity its own self-sustained Dow completely disjoint from all other Dows with its own web address canisters and databases this architecture makes Mass

04:04:30	hacks virtually impossible beyond the architecture are features that enable communities to grow and allocate wealth among themselves I'm Jesse Williams the creator of the personal Dow protocol reach out to me or any member of my team for questions I look forward to hearing from you [Music] all hi I'm LC Laura Cole and I'm an AI blockchain web 3 attorney I've been in this space for about 3 years I'm with industria business lawyers we've been serving anyone in the distributed Ledger technology space for a while and I have

04:05:09	the fortune of being here and speaking to the ICP CC community so I'm happy to be here here I think Dows are incredible we have yet to see like really the future of dows the first wave of dows came and they were definitely all about pooling money and making money which is really great and an awesome entry point I think the next wave we saw in the last Bull Run was a lot of dowo community and where Dows are headed will be so exciting to see I think you'll see corporations using Dows to innovate so

04:05:42	I'd love to see like a Google or an Amazon form a doubt internally and say hey someone from Finance someone from HR someone from Tech solve this internal issue publicly let me put up a bounty you guys decide who wants to be on this team how you want to tackle this problem and take that reward and go with it I think Dows in that sense fit a corporation but I think Dows in this next iteration of creativity will be so much more than that and that's what really excites me because I'd love to see Dows as a family Dows as community

04:06:14	Dows is collective bargaining like those are all more Innovative and creative ways to approach Dow and I think this next Bull will get us to the next layer of innovation just forming a group of people just forming Collective doesn't necessarily make it a legal entity if you get together with your group of friends and have dinner that's not a doubt it's not a legal entity but if you get together with a group of friends sharing funds or building a project chances are by default you might be considered a general partnership in the

04:06:47	US and a lot of other jurisdictions just doing that leaves you a lot of exposure there's different rappers legal rappers things that you might want to do to protect from that intense level of exposure so if you're ever going to join a dow you might want to be a little bit more thoughtful and ask the questions like is there a legal entity behind this because you saw a lot of States like Wyoming and Utah and New Hampshire create certain legislature that kind of supports Dao but it doesn't necessarily

04:07:15	solve what's really the exposure in that group share is the liability and there's not a lot of great Solutions out there that do cover that liability because that's your real exposure in a doubt so if you can find a solution that kind of addresses that liability it's it puts you in a a way better position and now you just have to be you know concerned about how the Dows run and who's who's following up with all these things and those other like cor of kind of normal business operation things that you would

04:07:45	want to have covered what we're seeing is similar to what happened in UK da so UK da was allegedly operating aex unlawfully and the US courts came after them but because it was a doubt and everyone was a non they chose purposefully to like not respond which led to a default judgment now all that's left is for the US to find one of those wallets and dox it in some way because then that person is unilaterally on the hook for everything so similarly if your Dow gets in trouble and there's a pool of money

04:08:25	but that doesn't cover everything and there's judgments against the the Dow that are more than that Dow holds every individual could be liable personally the US is very creative about reaching a cross jurisdictions if you're tapping into US dollars so I'm not saying that you know everyone's exposed in Uka if they're all non- US citizens but there's definitely more exposure the moment that you can track US Dollars into whatever it is that Dow is doing what you generally see set up that people are satisfied with for the most

04:09:03	part is a Delaware C cor because they definitely want to have other investors outside investors product investment then you have a Cayman Foundation that kind of runs the dowo aspect and then you have the BVI entity which is like what releases or launches that token and that's your most like classic setup as of this day but I don't think that'll always be here because now that the vast laws are in and each jurisdiction got so much action and so much funding they're starting to like tighten those

04:09:32	regulations and they're starting to pay attention a little bit more and not everything is as easy it's getting more expensive so I think we're going to have to look to more creative jurisdictions I think the most exciting one is the Marshall Islands with myow now that they've gone so hard at the liability I think they're going to address a lot more of the banking on ramps and making it really smooth I really think it could be the top entity jurisdiction to form a do one thing that Marshall Islands does

04:10:02	really well is IT addresses what happens when those tokens are no longer yours or you want to get rid of them they do uh a really great job of of addressing the fluidity of a DE out because that's one of the key factors of a doubt is that I'm here today and gone tomorrow because I was here for this one project and now I got a full-time job and I'm in the space differently or I was here for this one purpose we got we achieved that purpose and now there's no longer a need for this purpose and so you need a

04:10:31	jurisdiction that addresses the fluidity of a doubt and I think there are some exciting things happening in Marshall Islands there are some exciting things that are are attempting to be addressed with some different US states and looking into those is something I would highly suggest you should just be thoughtful about how you enter the space Maybe reaching out to the core team and say hey have you guys figured out or solved for the legal rapper and if so what does it look like and what's my exposure and

04:11:04	they should be able to answer at a high level if you have any concerns you can always talk to an attorney I think a great example is what this conference is doing they have thoughtfully approached the Marshal Islands have done the proper registration that powerful governance token that you'll get when you join this SNS when you join this D when you use that to vote you will have the protections that I mentioned and so this legal rapper is protecting you as a holder of that SNS token if you're an individual or you're

04:11:40	a project who's thinking about building has already built buil or needs to switch jurisdictions any sort of analysis I happily take uh like a 30-minute phone call my calendly is open uh just to talk you through some exposures and frictions so please reach out I'm available and I'm happy to talk this is just my favorite thing that's happening right now so love being in this space love talking to devs and Builders keep building but keep building thoughtfully [Music] all right we are back ICP and we just

04:12:19	heard from Laura Cole it was great to have Laura Cole back for her second year in a row talking about Dows as legal entities now real quick I do just want to give a quick reminder we're we're about you know a little over four hours in on this broadcast we got just under five remaining uh so make sure you're hitting a like subscribe on whichever platform you're currently viewing on uh let's see those memes for with the hashtag I # ipcc 2024 uh let's also tag uh ICP corcc whenever you're doing those

04:12:52	memes they're going to be giving out 10 ICP to the best meme so make sure you're doing that and you know coming up in a little bit too we're going to be hearing from joam Hartman again about the pcpcc SNS Dow uh launch tomorrow so if you're interested in that uh the launch is going to be at 1500 UTC and the first 8 80,000 ICP raise during that time is going to have a multiplier so if you want to participate consider uh participating early because it could get you extra rewards for participating so

04:13:26	uh let's get back to uh Johan here it's going to be coming up shortly I think there's an ad first but back to you guys hi everyone I'm Luca and together with my friend masimo we discovered about the boot camp while talking with other I developers we joined the motoco boot camp in Portugal which was in person it was great to work next to many other builders and get to know them personally after the boot camp we developed IC web sockets to enable canisters to send Real Time updates to clients and icite services to enable

04:14:03	Dows to manage the offchain services they depend upon the boot camp is the best way to get started developing on the IC and getting involved in the community there re no way you shouldn't get started learning about the IC and feel free to reach us out if you need any support hey guys my name is Oliver bar I'm the CEO and co-founder of finny finny is a decentralized borrowing lending protocol built on the internet computer it's similar to other defi lending protocols that have been built in the past like compound in a but we

04:14:44	get to take advantage of some of the special technology that's only available on the internet computer some of those things are access to cross-chain uh technology without the need for swaps and uh wrapping assets so you can lend assets on the Bitcoin blockchain and borrow them on the ICP blockchain without having to go through the expensive fees of bridging and all of the security headaches associated with that so if you want to learn more about finny you can check us out right now on Twitter we're at Fest IP um and we'll be

04:15:11	posting all of our major updates there so yeah sure to follow us at Pinterest [Music] ICP hi everyone this is Johan speaking today we'll be covering a few important terms uh in regards to Dows on the internet computer protocol the first term we'll be looking at is the nns so what is the nns it is actually the Dow that runs the internet computer protocol Network it's also the only way to update the source Cod of the protocol and it's actually extremely interesting because it puts the token holders in charge over

04:15:57	node providers or even core developers a second in an interesting term are neurons so what are neurons once you have your tokens you can stake them in neurons which will grant you governing rights you can also follow other neurons for voting which is extremely uh interesting in terms of liquid democracy the last term I would like to go through is uh the SNS so what's an SNS it is a dow created on a Lo pad which is on the nns it has gasless decentralized front end it gives the availability for those

04:16:28	to have a fully Unchained treasury with no custodians as a user it becomes extremely interesting because you can own and manage TS let's move on to the ICPC so what is the iccc Dao NLC you first have to know that the iccc is the first and larg event Series in the ICP ecosystem right now it is uh being launched as a SNS Dow hopefully it will become a community-owned and fully self-sustaining decentralized conference event series devoted to highlighting the icp's technology and ecosystem what will

04:16:59	this dowo do exactly going into 2025 the iccc Dao will host two type of events per year we will host a multi-day conference like the one last year in 2023 as well a global live stream like this year's event also key to know that all tickets VIP perks and merch will be collected in the native token and go straight back to the Dow treasury along with all the proceeds from event sponsorships so how will this work exactly right now the ICBC event is being launched into a SNS Dow with we specific components the first one to

04:17:31	know is that the dowo will be registered as a martial Islands dowo LLC which uh provides the da members liability protection it also gives the dowo corporate personhood so it can sign agreements own intellectual property or even higher employees which is extremely important the to we also have a council called the iccc council members will have no power to act on behalf of the Dao but they are simply community members that were selected by the Dao to submit quality proposals for you to vote on council members are selected or fired

04:18:05	and they are accountable to the Dao with protection to prevent them controlling too much influence over uh the voting power the general voting power and the final aspect which is a key document is the DA's ICBC Constitution it is ratified as an official uh governing document it is onchain gives the Dao specific processes for handling certain tasks such as hiring for example which um is extremely important how can you help now well if you believe in the decentralized future where communities can manage events I would totally

04:18:40	suggest you to have a look at launch. I B- cc.com [Music] all right we are back and great job from Yan Johan uh explaining the pcpcc da now again I just want to remind you all that uh we you know are all gathered here today to celebrate the community around the internet computer protocol which we are all passionate about um so again let's take a moment to get your feedback you know there's 23 meetups going on around the world uh share it with us your experience we want to see it in the comments and you know keep sharing the

04:19:20	links we're we're still chugging through this thing so chugga chugga shout out to you Dom and to everyone we we just make sure you're sharing your experience we'd love to hear what your favorite part has been so far as we continue on with this broadcast so let's continue on to make each year better and better and now we're going to go into uh a little bit of a influencer slot coming up here after a few ads uh but we're going to be highlighting some more influencers soon and then we're going to finally have

04:19:48	some people rolling into Milwaukee uh and celebrating uh you know internet computer and then we'll get to our panels later so uh let's tune into the ads and then we'll go into uh the next influencer slot here soon hello ipcc Community my name is Nelson lumbres it's an honor to stand before you today and present the work we've been undertaking as part of the ICP he Philippines we stand as firm Advocates of blockchain and icp's transformative potential our mission is clear to transform Filipinos from Mere

04:20:27	users into Builders leveraging the power of ICP to Foster Innovation and economic progress for our country our journey do far has been marked by a series of impactful initiatives including events amas contest articles and Outreach programs the numbers speak volumes over 100 video contents 10,000 plus shares 100,000 plus views a million plus Impressions and more but beyond mere statistics our Focus lies on education as evidenced by our University Caravans boot camps and hackaton which have empowered over 500 developers and over

04:21:09	20 plus projects building on the ICP main net looking ahead our vision expands to incubation and Business Development we are proud to announce that we will be launching soon our incubation program we want to contribute to the Olympus accelerator program by the definity foundation and we will be collaborating with Angel Investors and VCS we aim to catalyze growth and Foster a Vibrant Community of Filipino Builders follow us on our social media platforms join us in our endeavors and together let us propel IP to new heights I extend

04:21:45	my gratitude to the organizers sponsors and fellow speakers for this opportunity special thanks to Isaac estan and the entire team cheers to all congratulations ipcc thank you and see you all [Music] all right I hope you caught that airdrop from Icy Lighthouse and I do want to give a quick shout out to the ICP Hub Philippines who just spoke in the last video um and you know real quick uh just a reminder make sure you're subscribing to the YouTube channel and re-sharing uh the link for the stream uh # ipcc 2024

04:22:41	is the message you need to have included in Your Meme when you post and tag the pcpcc account on Twitter let's get those memes in I've been seeing some really like really funny ones coming in and we've been retweeting some as well from our account um now we're going to go over and hear from crypto Darren who's been uh a very big contributor to helping us expand the ICP ecosystem so let's uh go over there nfid vaults the only product more secure than a hardware wallet vaults are self- sovereign smart

04:23:16	contracts capable of securing any asset on any network security is customizable with the multiactor approval engine this gives your assets maximum protection from any form of loss like government seizure wallet loss and cyber theft go Sovereign with an nfid vault [Music] your success is directly proportional to our ability to understand adopt and integrate new technologies into our work fact has a movement behind it and is attracting many of the world's smartest people to work on it basically the

04:24:05	criticisms end up being the criticisms play out differently than than the critics think so the the critics make this long list of all of the problems and and you know you alluded to like you know there's long list of all the problems with ethereum today or a long list of all the problems with Bitcoin or whatever um and then it's like but you're getting these genius engineers and entrepreneurs right would flood into the into the into the space which is what's happening right now and and what happens is they look at that list of

04:24:28	problems as a list of opportunities right they're like okay like that's the punch list like these are the things that I can do because if I fix these problems it's going to be really important it's going to really matter I'm going to be famous right I can build a real business like you know this is going to be how I'm going to make my mark in the world is I'm going to fix these problems and so you get I don't know it'd be like if you had a house project or something the house was going sideways and you had

04:24:48	all these complaints and then like all of the world's best Architects and like you know Master Builders like showed up you know the next day to like fix your house like and you've got like all these incredible you know amazing you know whatever it's just like all of a sudden you've got the best house in the world right and and and that this can actually happen in this kind of world this can actually happen Markin dreon and another BC Venture capitalists are trying to pinpoint the best crypto assets the

04:25:12	crypto assets they want to invest in and one of the metrics they use is by developer activity how many how many different developers are interested in the technology but you see with definity it's not so much developers there's phds they're some of the best of the best that have joined affinity's mission on creating the world's internet computer ask me for the block but if I have a very small artifact like you know a you know a signature share involved in the chain key or something like that it's only a few bites I won't send you

04:25:49	an adver I'll just send you the you know send you the artifact and probably you'll receive it you know multiple times through multiple nodes uh but but you know optimizing all of this um is is is complicated and it's a full-time job and we have like a team of like you know um I forget how big the PTP team is but you're talking about a whole bunch of P phds who do nothing except work on optimizing the PTP protocol so I mean you know just the team that we've got you know we've got probably got more

04:26:18	phds working on uh just the P2P protocol that most blockchains have working on you know the core core core protocol that they use it's like a massive you know what we do is like a massive undertaking but um you know it it it works and it and and the the the stats and the performance figures um tell tell the story I mean uh it's currently doing 230,000 eth equivalent transactions a second on average but that's a tiny fraction of what we want it to be doing we want to see it doing billions of eth

04:26:49	equivalent transactions a second and and actually that's really you know it the network that you see today is capable of doing that um it it's just it'll grow as more and more people build on the internet computer Dominic Williams states that phds from around the world have been working on different aspects of the internet computer progr call and they created something called CK bridging which means chainkey bridging and what happens in defi is multisig wallets are created in order to create Bridges and these multisig WS

04:27:29	have been attacked they've been attacked by nation states such as North Korea Lazarus group is a North Korean hacking group that has stolen billions of dollars from defi ecosystem and then has used things like tornado cash in order to launder money from defi now CK bridging is a completely new design that has not been hacked and this is the way ICP plans on taking assets from various cryptocurrencies and bringing them on chain so not only are you going to have Bitcoin and ethereum the rc20 tokens but

04:28:08	there's a plan to to bring on all crypto assets onto the the ICP protocol right now most crypto assets can be bridged to the ICP protocols as long as the elliptical curve is is met there's there's something called an elliptical curve and that's the encryption type of the crypto asset and there is a plan to to bring on uh different different crypto assets that have different elliptical curves right now um ICP only supports certain elliptical curves as far as I understand it but sooner or later every single

04:28:48	crypto asset will be interoperable with internet computer protocol so so this the dissimilarity so the big dis the big dissimilarity or the thing that's not the same I think is it's this untrusted versus trusted thing right so the on the internet the answer almost always was to liberate right uh for the internet 1.0 2.0 the answer almost always was to liberate it was to create basically basically break down walls um have more people to be able to participate have more people to be able to build apps

04:29:15	right have more freedom you know it's why the internet had this incredible ethos of freedom of speech for a long time right that kind of is changed a bit more recently but like you know for a very long time it was you know this is this is you know sort of inherently a free speech environment uh the internet was supposed to have freedom of speech and freedom of speech is a very big deal and we've seen big Tech abuses power we've seen presidents get kicked off of social media we've seen other forms of

04:29:43	abuse is I personally self-censor on YouTube because I'm afraid that I will be deplatformed but with the internet computer protocol what you have is something called the network nervous system which is a dow that governs the entire network and we can all agree that there are certain things that nobody wants to see on the internet things that violate Universal Norms Society has said certain things are unacceptable and we can all agree on that so the biggest criticism that that people say about ICP

04:30:20	is that it's not exactly censorship resistance because the network nervous system is able to censor certain things well in reality on the on the next form of the internet we don't want every subject to be put on the internet there's there's certain things that I'm sure you can think of that you don't want to see on the in sign messages probably you know messages which contain function calls and function call results that are being passed to other subnets and the way the system is designed is you know if these signatures chain key

04:30:58	signatures on the messages check out um not only can the other subnets see that the message hasn't been tampered with but also that the other subnet is running correctly and then you know there's a special subet on the internet computer which runs something called the network nervous system which is a dow it's actually the biggest Dow in the world it's got more than3 billion worth of ICP Stak inside and has participation in the hundreds of thousands and but this is a dow not only is it the world's biggest Dow it's also

04:31:26	a dow like unlike any other um people propose uh changes and configurations um uh to the network to this network nervous system and if it adopts them they're uh executed completely automatically so the entire Network's autonomous and you know runs by people you know submitting proposals that are adopted or rejected to the network n system is permissionless anyone could submit these proposals but it's uh works well enough that any of the sensible proposals get adopted um but this this thing this

04:32:00	network nervous system anyway is not only you know it's it's creating subnets to scale the network as needed and maintaining a kind of directory of subnets um and you know when it creates a new subnet it signs the public key of the subnet there are computers that are custom tailored for ICP and subnet Orcs or groups of these computers but together if you wanted something that was extremely decentralized you can obviously up the number of nodes or if you want something that's a bit more centralized you could lower the amount

04:32:33	of nodes depending on what you're trying to achieve the network nervous system connects all these subn networks together and every time that a key is passed on and make sure that the subn network is operating properly and making sure that it's following all the rules that it's supposed to be following now the network nervous system I would Define as the global Dow the ICP token is the global Ledger that connects all these sub networks together if you wanted to configure the IC protocol or change a certain design of the IC

04:33:13	protocol the sub networks will put up an amendment and the entire network nervous system would vote on the amendment if the amendment passed it would automatically be adopted it would be autonomous and created instantaneously so it's just sort of this iconic you know well the the the classic essay as John Perry Barlo wrote he called this is like 25 years ago now I called it the Declaration of the independence of cyberspace right and it was basically it and if you read it it's like a very poetic thing and it's like

04:33:42	basically we're going to leave you and your grubby World behind right and and it was again it was this kind of spirit of Liberation actually a lot of it actually came out of the' 60s it was kind of part of the cultural revolution at the time and so you were you were you were kind of driving towards less you know less and less trust um you know less and less permission less and less Authority right over time and then but but like I said what what were we missing we were missing the other side we were therefore missing trust we were

04:34:05	missing you know Authority we were missing permission we were missing you know the ability to transact with people form trusted relationships transact send money store money like and then have all the other economic Arrangements that that you know kind of that the world wants to have you know loans and contracts and insurance and all all these all these other things like we we just didn't have any of that and so so there is this other side to it which is at least the way I think about it is web

04:34:26	3 is bringing trust to an untrusted Network um right but and look there there was trust involved like we had people had to believe that encryption worked right and so you know there there were trusted components to what we built um but the big thing here that strikes me is just like this is an opportunity to build the internet sort of Internet phase two you know web three is like an opportunity to basically build trust into this untrust environment and have people come out the other side of this

04:34:48	being like okay like for example we could actually imagine the entire global economy running on the blockchain like we like the entire thing like we could imagine 30 years from now or 50 years from now like the entire global economy Cuts over right and everything Cuts over and right and and what would it mean for that to happen and how would people have to feel about that and that's a that that that's a very different kind of problem than than the one that we had the crypto asset movement is about

04:35:12	peer-to-peer transactions being able to buy and sell things directly to one another without having a central intermediary you see it was always necessary to have some type of bank or Central intermediary to make sure that transactions between buyers and sellers were fair but now with this technology you could host anything of value on the web and these Marketplace could be completely autonomous there could be a level of Truth baked into the protocols in which we buy and sell Assets Now what's interesting is at the time these

04:35:58	Central intermediaries were actually an innovation by themselves this was actually a very positive thing that made the world more efficient actually having banks that can make loans to people or or or having dtcc issue stocks and people being able to know exactly how many stocks were issued and having these systems were an innovation at the time well now fast forward to today we no longer need these Central intermediaries and what we found out is over the years they are extremely costly to run not

04:36:37	only are they costly to run and there are attacks on everybody but there's corruption that gets baked into these systems because these systems are made of people people that are able to get bribed people that are able to be corrupted but today we're able to create all of this with code code that's not corruptable at one point the idea of a central bank was was this great idea that was going to make the the country more efficient and what has happened is central banks have printed they've bailed out Wall Street they got together

04:37:18	with the government has started printing money at will and defeated the whole purpose of a central bank but you see with technology like blockchain you you you're able to create a system that has inflation baked at 2% that has maximum employment baked into it A system that doesn't have a group of Elders that make decisions for the entire country now imagine if there was there was a network that had 2% inflation baked into it and had maximum employment these things are completely possible and what we're seeing is is a

04:38:02	push out from the central in medaries we're seeing a push from regulators and and and the the old old system because this threatens that old Paradigm and eventually that old Paradigm is going to fold because it has it's it's always fold and throughout the history of time Fiat has always come to an end and this this time is no different it will return to its intrinsic value was very easy for me I picked it up immediately uh it was fun I deployed a smart contract really quick um it was just so much easier for

04:38:44	me to pick up motco than to pick up hasco plutus and I've spoken to uh my former business partner about this William and he agrees that hasal plutus is hard but he thinks it's a good thing I think it's a bad thing and the reason why I think the difficulty of has plutus is a bad thing is because your most creative entrepreneurs are not really like technical like that right your your most creative entrepreneurs uh some of them know how to code but most of them can even code right let alone expecting them to pick

04:39:14	up something so difficult so I think because creatives is who you want on your platform because creative they're the one that's good with the community right they're the one that like everyone follows right you want creatives on your platform and because cardano's so hard I actually see less creatives going over to cardano I couldn't pick it up right and and I'm a developer I mean I'm not the brightest developer out there right there's definitely Engineers way better than me but I couldn't pick it up you

04:39:41	know I'm just going to be honest with you I it was it was just too hard for me and Moto it was like this I picked up so fast it was just very rapid and organic for me so I'm going to give it to uh ICP in term of programming language because it's more developer friendly in my opinion yeah I just kind of wanted to speak to the original question you posed I can't speak about how they how they onboarded developers at the protocol level to establish the foundation but from the application Level as somebody

04:40:07	as a developer who who uses the product in my personal opinion the developer experience is uh is is really good prior to coding on the internet computer I attempted another product uh and I was going to use AWS and the difference in you know like uh just getting started in the development process and making use of the technology was way more streamlined it was as simple as it downloaded an fdk and running commands that wasn't my experience with Amazon web services you you you pretty much need to be an expert at AWS and or

04:40:38	before you can even begin you know coding and application as a frontend developer or backend developer you got to learn AWS and how to manipulate that with the internet computer that's not the case when I started developing I had only had experience as a front-end engineer prior you know anything outside of that I had to learn it along the way and so there was already a steep learning curve and not having that issue at the onset of development of having to figure out a whole new platform before I

04:41:05	can even begin you know the the million mile March that was a that was a really pleasant experience for my and I think it makes it easier for on board on boarding developers moving forward I have heard numerous testimonials that the ICP protocol is one of the easiest protocols to develop on for several different reasons but what's interesting about the IC protocol is that there is something called the reverse gas fee model that allows the developers to fill the application up with ICP tokens and

04:41:40	the users don't even really realize that they're using the protocol on the back end those tokens are being burnt every time a transaction takes place but this means survival of the Fist the best applications the applications that actually earn an income are the ones that are going to be the ones that Thrive and survive the ones that nobody wants to use well they'll naturally die out over time the idea here is that like like o or like wallets that are built in a similar way on the in computer and we

04:42:13	have like a few more like astrox or nfid and other wallets who actually do the same thing so you can uh and we did this this morning right so we fire up Unis slop with wallet connect connect the O wallet right and so you can on the one hand transact your your stuff on ethereum or then guess that's what is to come you could also do the same transactions on the intern computer right and so right now I see this of course much more liquidity there's more more tokens to trade but eventually people will realize if you do the same

04:42:46	thing on the inter computer it's like far cheaper right for for few transaction fees and therefore the DAT will also like have some liquidity some more defi are actually native on the internet computer prot yeah I think the crypto world is filled with tribal maximalist and what we should tell them is they should go to their favorite coins website and see if it's centralized they should see if their wallet can be downloaded off of the Play Store they should see if they can get a backup exe file of their wallet on a

04:43:22	decentralized protocol because ICP the internet computer protocol can do all that for them and maybe there could be a hybrid of their favor coin and the IC protocol I believe it's not the technology that changes the world it's the dream behind the technology that changes the world thanks everyone I hope thanks everyone I hope you enjoyed the show you can find me on youtube.com Daren moorejr or you can just type in darrenm Jr in the search bar or you can find me on Twitter as Fame 21 more I'm regularly hosting X

04:49:16	are old and ogs like me I consider myself an OG we've been here since $400 and it's been we've had a hell of a roller coaster ride I don't know what the ICP Price is Right now this video is being pre-recorded I've been here from the top I was here with you guys at 280 and I was Bull posting at 280 so a lot of you guys probably think I'm crazy and a lot of people think all of us are crazy but let me tell you there is no other blockchain technology that is more advanced than the internet computer you

04:49:45	can have the naysayers talking about decentralization and nodes and blah blah blah blah blah it doesn't matter the internet computer is by far the best crypto technology that the world has ever seen so I am so happy and so glad to be here thank you everyone for watching all of my videos thank you everyone for commenting liking all of my posts retweeting I appreciate all of the love that you've given me as some of you guys have sent me gifts I sent some of you guys gifts so thank you so so so so

04:50:14	so much I also want to take a little bit of this time to give a shout out and a public thank you to three important figures in the crypto ecosystem the first person I want to give a shout out and thanks to is Ash crypto the second one windows98 and the third one tendy token so guys you're probably wondering Victor what why are you thanking these people a while back around Christmas time I participated in a giveaway from Ash crypto he said he wanted to make like five people or 10 people's wish come true for Christmas I of course said

04:50:43	I want to feed a 100 Mexican children for Christmas I did not think I was going to win and guys I won so Ash crypto again huge shout out because Ash crypto is one of the first large crypto influencers on X to give a shout out to ICP so he bought at $2.80 and a lot of people were so scared and they were staying away from ICP Ash crypto did not so Ash crypto if you're watching this shout out to you you made a huge difference in these kids' lives so we bought a lot of this fried chicken and we had money left over so we made

04:51:14	individual grocery bags for people eating 100 Mexican kids became a reality so check out the footage it broke my heart to not have enough money to give all of these children some groceries to take home but we gave a lot of them groceries and that's enough we also gave away one soccer ball to a winner of a little soccer tournament that we did these kids their face was glowing up this was a $10 soccer ball and their face was just glowing in this time these people privately gave to me so I want to

04:51:40	publicly give give them a shout out and say thank you God bless you as crypto God bless you thank you very much Window 98 tendy token all of you guys thank you I was the boots on the ground the people that helped me with the boots on the ground but you guys were the financiers to use crypto in order to feed children in Mexico so thank you very much if I ever do another one I will let you guys know I'll post it on Twitter I'm hoping to do at least one this year either for Christmas or for children's day so thank

04:52:08	you guys very very very much you made an incredible lifechanging difference in these Children's Life uh so thank you very much now that that's side I will also take a little bit of time to show my personal project I am launching a project called NFD leria for those of you that don't know what leria is Laria is a form of Mexican Bingo normal Bingo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 numbers boring Mexican Laria has iconic characters to the Mexican culture like El Boro El Diablo La chalupa Etc so these characters I am building these by hand

04:52:44	and by editing some of them I'm just changing the image a little bit so it looks more in the theme I am using it to put elements of crypto like Bitcoin Litecoin nfts and of course ICP this is an ICP themed project there are only 1,000 pieces of NFD ladas I'm going to hand out 50 today to those watching this video so go follow at Victor ICB Squad and I might retweet a new page for nft loas follow that follow all of the instructions and I'm giving away 50 you can follow all of the rules from your

04:53:15	jurisdiction you can give out the prices as a form of Engagement whatever your jurisdiction allows you can go ahead and do that in the future we are going to build a decentralized application so in case some of you are saying hey I don't trust the guy with a cards if you do make the game show the people the cards make sure they they are uh correct cards and then shuffle them or whatever but then after that we're going to work on the development of a decentralized application that picks the winners knows

04:53:37	which wallet is the winner knows that the wallet really is holding the nft and then can receive the money uh keep a percentage for the person hosting the game or charge a token fee uh for hosting the game and you can play nft l so with all of that being said this for all of my announcements have a great wonderful time this is Victor ICP catch you next time we're all going to make it [Music] I'm Alando Hutchings the founder of IC footprint IC footprint is the home of sustainability on ICP we've already

04:54:36	developed the foundational green computer capabilities that have set up ICP as a lead in this industry but the importance of further pushing the ESG capabilities of the network cannot be overstated and that's particularly true as we move into the age of AI ai's veracious appetite for compute means this electricity consumption and corresponding carbon emissions are coming under increasing scrutiny we aim to offer seamless onchain ICP ESG capabilities to all adaps snss subnets wallets tokens and future Utopia

04:55:05	instances ESG capabilities are set to become a seamless part of all ICP Network activi see [Music] you I've been involved with what became the internet computer since 2015 2016 a long time ago and of course we all know and love what the internet computer can do today it's extraordinary and really fulfills a lot of the ambition that was imagined so long ago then we created origin before the acronym rwa even became popular we were working with real world assets creating digital twins of uh real world physical objects and

04:55:56	natively digital ones and origin is built on the internet computer to take advantages of all those wonderful properties like having everything on chain storing vast amounts of data even containing uh Marketplace staps within a a canister or an nft definity of course the main contributor to the internet computer and the origin Foundation the initial main contributor to the origin protocol are both foundations you know not for profits the original ambition was right from the start from my standpoint to migrate Enterprise and

04:56:26	Industry Global Enterprise and Industry to true web 3 infrastructure hence the need to build on the internet computer and origin that ambition obviously involves working with a large number and an increasing number of large organizations companies government departments all sorts of entities industry leaders around the world to help them migrate their Commerce their operations their systems to web three infrastructure now obviously that's a very large undertaking you know working with a lot of large organizations to do

04:56:55	that now it's not really in the mission of definity or origin to fund all of that work you the mission of definity and origin are to improve their protocols and that's where their resources and funding should be pointed so as we matured this whole stack we always knew we were going to need as the whole stack became more successful and more Enterprise industry wanted to access that stack we always knew we'd need other organizations as integrators to go out and work with those large organizations and Industry to help them

04:57:26	move to web 3 and these organizations need to be for-profit so they can charge industry and Enterprise for the considerable work and effort involved in plugging them into that stack so they can take advantage of these great new properties that takes the cost burden off organizations like definity and origin foundation so they can use their funds to continuously improve the protocols that's where pan industrial came from pan industrial is the first such integrator that's anointed to go and bring large industry to web 3 by the

04:57:56	likes of origin so that uh they can plug into real world asset infrastructure that's well classed and best to breed on the internet computer and everyone can keep doing what they're good at they can stay in their Lane you know definity and others can keep improving the internet computer computer protocol origin foundation and others can keep improving the origin protocol and pan industrial can go and collect these large players in Industry around the world and bring them to that stack whenever appropriate

04:58:23	and so now we have proper separation of duties of funding of finance and everything else and focus that layer cake is kind of after you know 9 years of work we now have all the pieces in the right place to really migrate Global Enterprise and Industry to real web 3 [Music] hello ICP Community we are pleased to have this opportunity to deliver our message to you at ipcc 2024 this video production will shed some light on why our group was created what our purpose is in the ecosystem and our many goals and future plans for

04:59:02	helping to shape the internet computer protocol into the most successful and transparent blockchain in crypto ICP protector is an inter at computer Watchdog group that is comprised of multiple mostly Anonymous OG and long-term ICP community members that have a deep passion for the internet computer protocol many people are afraid to step on the toes or speak out against influential figures or projects that are participating in wrongdoing so that's where we step in we're here to represent those who may be afraid or intimidated

04:59:34	to speak out against corruption and shake the air we have multiple post writers on our social medias and often posts cannot be reviewed or agreed upon by all of our members due to time limitations and activity we are human and do make mistakes but we are extremely careful to only post anything accurate and factual our excellent track record so far speaks for itself education and access to factual information relating to the many projects on ICP is something that we believe is clearly needed in the

05:00:05	community with our efforts we can make improvements in these areas we all do this out of love for ICP and its amazing community no one likes to be scammed and that is not the way to grow a successful and trusted ecosystem any reduction in scams and illegal activity will benefit everyone in ICP our focus is to create a type of rating system for The Meta tokens and nft projects on ICP this will be an objective checklist of sword that rates projects on a list of criteria that will help to paint a better picture

05:00:37	of the legitimacy or trust of the project we will like to completely decentralize ICP protector and give the ICP Community the chance to participate and vote on proposals in the rating of projects to provide a community score a report to ear model Our advice for all of you out there always do your own research who is the founder Creator is it a fair launch check the wife paper check the top 100 holder who is promoting it how long is the project endeav in the ICP Community if you are not sure how to do it we we will provide

05:01:11	a video as soon as our platform is online we appreciate any input or suggestions from the community on how we can improve and best serve the community as we grow with ICP over the many years to come let's all work together to build the best ecosystem and promote the real projects while reducing the amount of scams fraud and Bad actors protect your ICP and don't risk it in scam projects it's going to be unbelievably valuable one day we will always keep an out there is no hiding from ICP protector all right we are back and you

05:01:48	know I just want to do a quick check cuz we're 5 hours in now how's everyone feeling uh I know a lot of people are at the 23 locations around the world right now um and make sure you continue to use # ipcc 2024 whenever you're addressing us with a tweet so we can keep track of those memes also tag ipcc uh I see we just had Jesse Williams coming to the house tonight uh just joined us here in Milwaukee he's going to be on a panel with us later uh those will be coming up um in just a few hours uh but yeah we're basically right now 5

05:02:21	hours in and we're going to do another influencer highlight and right now we are going to see um a short film from Bitcoin Renegade so tune in to that and we'll see you in a bit ID geek marketplace where you can securely transfer sell request alone for your locked assets such as SNS neurons or the whole internet identity so in case of emergency you can check ID geek to find some liquidity for your locked assets for those new IND a system you have good chance to buy certain assets with a good discount you got to be quick

05:03:00	because uh good offers with like 30 40% discount they disappear in seconds [Music] [Music] welcome in ipcc Renegades and today we are going to give you an insane ICP steak rewards ultimate guide and this is to help you get familiar with the internet computer and what these staking and governance can offer you for benefits now we are going to go in and look at the nns real quick and then we are going to show you the insane rewards that you can get we're going to calculate them and show you the benefits of staking on the

05:04:02	internet computer and then we are going to hear from people that have used the staking feature besides myself and their experience with that so let's get right into this and I hope you are enjoying pcpcc so far I made a video before on this so if you want to get an intricate guide on how to use this I did make a previous video and you can check that out this is going to be a guide to show you the benefits and the insane rewards and how you can get those so basically what you do is you lock up ICP and you

05:04:33	can vote on the governance of the internet computer and you can um decide the future of the internet computer and you do that by locking up these things called ICP tokens and I have several different neurons um and I have them all set for different dissolve delays because the the most beneficial part of staking the internet computer is you can choose the time frame that you want to stake your ICP as you see I have an 8-year one here I have a 5year 135 day one I have a one year and so on and as you see I'm doing this as a strategic

05:05:10	way to unlock ICP at different times that I can maximize my rewards and profits but also still support the internet computer and have my say in these votes there's a lot of cool things that you can vote on like upcoming SNS proposals um which you can check out on my other video as well so basically we are going to start out with this aye and I'm going to show you the benefit we're going to show what it would be like to have a th000 ICP basically in each of these and I'm going to tell you why each

05:05:39	of these time frames so eight years right here with dissolved delay not pressed um so 30 ICP with no dissolved delay means I have not started dissolving which means this eight years um will not start going going down at all um the eight years that I have it locked for will not go down um until I start this dissolve delay why wouldn't I want to press that why do I want to keep it locked up well this age bonus as you see is 398 it will grow over time so if I calculate this to the bull run after the next8 years which eight years from

05:06:14	right now would be 2032 and if we go the next year after that so I could do a one-year age bonus and then start dissolving for eight years and hit the 2033 bull runs say 1,000 say I get 1,000 ICP in there and then uh so we could do it for 9 years so that would be the 2033 and then we'll look at it after so as you see here with this I can get more than double my ICP out of this 1,000 will turn into 2,238 over the next nine years that means I don't press that button for a year I press it after a year for eight

05:06:54	years and then I get 123. 185% return on investment so that is more than double your ICP you can either take all of this out you know during the time or you could just leave it in there and end up you know with uh 22 2 38 if you add another zero to this it just changes you get even more and if you add 100,000 I mean you're going to get 123,000 out of that so it's just crazy insane rewards that you would get now I want to show you this in the neuron sandbox now so say we have 1,000 ICP and we want to put the dissolve delay for 8

05:07:33	years you get 100% disolve delay bonus for that and we will not start dissolving yet we will uh we will wait for a year and then we will start dissolving so as you see here age 220 days so we'll pause this at one year we haven't staked any maturity we've already got 11820 in less than a year this is crazy and that age bonus is going up too 5.7 already so we're going to start dissolving so at one year we stop um this and we will start dissolving let's see how many rewards we got 153.7 six in one year out of a thousand

05:08:20	that is about 15% of your total ICP in one year that is insane right there so now let's start dissolving and then continue now let's stake this maturity as you see it spikes back up this is the best way to maximize your rewards and I would keep staking this as much as possible during this eight years I would just keep staking it keep staking it until it can't be staked anymore as you see the amount of ICP and voting power you have goes up you will get less rewards because you started dissolving

05:09:08	right so if you want do it for longer you can do that shorter you can do that um but that is that for this one if we go back and we look at my other one let's see the uh fiveyear one so this is for five years and this is going to unlock in the 2028 29 Bull Run and I'm going to add to this have this really go up so I'm we're going to do five years so let's do that on here and the dissolve delay is going to be the same it's five years five months so five years five months that is a lot less than nine years and I still

05:09:50	get 1629.2rpm [Music] are going to um stake your ICP to get the most reward you saw with your own eyes that this is one of the best staking protocols that I've ever used it has the best features by allowing you to participate in creating Dows and participating in their ecosystems as well as staking your ICP shaping the future of ICP and now we're going to hear some testimonials of people that have used the staking features themselves and their experience with it ladies and gents I'm six figs and we're

05:10:45	going to be talking about the governance and the nns baby now we're going to be looking at three key things that I think are important when you're looking at the nns we're going to be talking about governance staking rewards and we're going to be talking about security because I feel like these are the cornerstones of the nns and what the majority of people use the nns for now when it comes down to governance staking your ICP in the nns will give you voting power and the longer you stake the more

05:11:17	voting power you get the more you stake the more voting power you get now this is very important uh for the internet computer security which we'll talk about in just a second as well but it might also be an Avenue where people seek out rewards for staking their IP as of this video in April May of 2024 you can see that there is a generous 15.5% is annualized return uh on your on your rewards so this is very nice so every 100 ICP you stake over the year you'll get 15 approximately uh assuming that

05:11:57	this number stays the same ICP uh as reward so uh there is a lot of good things going here but the thing is if you stake your ICP for eight years you're in it for eight years now this doesn't necessarily mean that's a bad thing because if you are a super bull like myself when it comes down to the ICP we plan on being around for decades to come so it's very important that we have a lot of people staking even one ICP 10 ICP it doesn't matter we just need those votes to help secure the nns when I mention security I'm also

05:12:38	talking about the security of the nns the security of the direction that ICP is going to move forward with when it comes down to it definity and the a are really releasing their voting power to the community you can see on this alltime chart that it is significantly lowering each month uh so if everybody has a say in voting on the nns this really helps prevent malicious proposals from getting passed now this is a great way to protect the internet computer when Mob Rules as long as the mob is good when Mob Rules you can knock

05:13:24	these types of malicious proposals down things like that uh so that is kind of the short and sweet my take on the nns Bitcoin Renegades got some great information in this video that he's prepared for you today love you all peace why stake ICP on the nns um first I'd say yield uh 15.4% is what it's at right now and that's higher than other l1's and infrastructure networks in the space as far as I know um I do like the fact that the rewards acre as maturity first so claiming and converting that maturity to

05:13:57	ICP isn't as much of a tax burden sometimes you can kind of pick and choose uh your timing depending on the market conditions um it's also really nice to be able to have a gas free transaction action when you're claiming that's not so on a lot of other networks I I stake in other places and I'm constantly you know having to pay gas fees just to to claim some some amount of rewards um and then lastly I like that you know you get to participate in governance and Security in the network uh that's very important and then you

05:14:30	know if it's if it can be overwhelming or um say for topics or times where you lack the knowledge or conviction or available time to do your research on a given governance subject or proposal you can uh choose to follow the vote of stakers or organizations whose discernment you trust in the network hey Will here I'd like to share with you three reasons why I love staking on the internet computer blockchain very simple number one gas fees I checked the other day and my ethereum use and I'm not a heavy

05:15:04	ethereum user my ethereum use over the last two and a half years I paid $3,000 in gas fees okay and a lot of that probably most of it was from staking tokens staking unstaking approving the contract you know every time it was like $100 here $100 there $100 here ICP there's no gas fees really so you know I stake and unstake is pretty much you know very fluidly right um with no fees so gas fees is number one number two is the fact that the n is very secure I don't have any issues I don't have to use metamask I don't have

05:15:43	to be walking on eggshells uh you know anytime I can stay liquid transfer the ICP to coinbase if I want transfer it back in uh it's very seamless I feel very secure and very safe I log in biometrically I log in with my finger amazing right so that's number two number three is that I can acrw extra rewards they are called voting rewards right so I can actually vote on the governance of the internet computer protocol blockchain but I don't have to deal with staying on top of all the issues in day-to-day voting because

05:16:19	there's a thing called follow neurons so there's people in the ecosystem that I really respect and I trust their judgment and I can hit a little button and I follow them and what that means is whatever they vote it counts that I voted also it's called following someone by proxy it's called a follow neuron okay so I don't have to keep on top of every little thing and I get more rewards for my tokens by using these follow neurons so I follow people that I respect in the ecosystem I know that they're staying on top of things I know

05:16:53	that they're voting right sometimes it's a dow or a group of people and my vote just goes with their vote right so very simple so there's my three reasons why I love staking on ICP no gas fees and very secure and the fact that I can acrw extra rewards through these uh governance mechanisms fantastic right hey this is space AP here so um I'm just going to talk a little bit about staking on internet computer and um basically the staking rewards are amazing if you um take uh 1,000 ICP and stake it for 8 years

05:17:34	roughly you'll get 25 200 ICP you'll have 2500 ICP at the end of the years and um if ICP goes to 1,000 bucks it' be $2.5 million um I just saw on Twitter today um if ICP has the same market cap as eth that it as its all-time high it' be $1,237 anyway I'm really excited about staking rewards on internet computer and I encourage everyone to give it a second lit y'all have a great [Applause] day I hope we were able to help you understand the internet computer and the benefits of staking the ICP coin on the

05:18:17	nns so I recommend that you get over and check out voting in the governance and if you want to stake your internet computer so I hope you're are going to enjoy pcpcc all right guys that being said goodbye and good ICP [Music] [Music] all right we are now back and I hope you all are enjoying yourselves with the pcpcc 2024 uh make make sure you're using that hashtag and just a brief reminder uh like and sub uh subscribe and also share the link let's get it spread out we are being helped by our Media Partners here today we have been

05:19:19	shared on coin Telegraph uh crypto slate uh blockchain pill and B crypto and of course our swap team is here holding down the broadcast so we appreciate you all tuning in and real quick we're going to do a speedrun through some projects building on ICP and we'll hear from some clowns and some other projects here very shortly so check it out we building a website on the internet computer or uh to permanently Arch historical documents and I'm currently graduating from a computer science degree program also just a months ago my

05:19:53	friend Arthur introduced me to this amazing project and the makoko boot camp and in that uh intense onewe boot camp I learned Mako a brand new language specifically designed for the internet computer it was actually a Incredible Journey to discover how kister and just the theal language itself I'm going to tell you how our website works and imagine a platform where anyone can contribute and ensure the past is preserved forever That's History da here's the exciting part anyone can submit historical documents like text

05:20:25	files on our website and to get your document featured we hold daily auction using IP tokens the winner gets their document permanently stored on the blockchain accessible to everyone and forever this is like a digital time C capsule and accessible to everyone forever if you're passionate about coding and want to learn the latest advancements in blockchain development the Mako boot camp is the place to be it's an incredible opportunity to gain new skills and work on project that make a real difference so join the B boot

05:20:53	camp explore the power ofo [Music] bye all nfts are good for is cartoon monkeys and punks right the original concept for them included a much wider scope than just digital art so let's dive into the wonderful world of nfts firstly WTF does nft mean nfts or non-fungible tokens simply mean a unique digital one-of-a-kind token the ownership and uniqueness are verified using blockchain so nfts can't be duplicated or forged and ownership can be easily traced for example Bitcoins are fungible one Bitcoin is exactly the

05:21:38	same as another zebras are nonf fungible unless you're using them for meat but that would be horrible so back to the huge potential of nfts I mentioned the ethereum blockchain made taking pictures and turning them into a tradable token pretty easy but people still can't really do a great deal else on ethereum using the internet computer we can now prove just how interesting nfts can be an nft can be anything another player would be interested in buying anything that has a state that nft can then then

05:22:09	be sold with full ownership transferred to another party the new owner can use the nft so it would re-enter wherever it came from in the same state or be stored for later so whether that's a dynamic Magic the Gathering card a World of Warcraft character with all achievements gear and reputation a partially completed yzi scorecard a Neopets character with all items levels and pet pets or just an unfinished chess game an nft can be anything that another person would want to use or complete so how

05:22:38	would this work in dragons players will be able to turn some of their tradable spells and items into nfts these can then be traded on any nft Marketplace to another dragons player doing this is a great way to freeze something in time and transfer the ownership to someone else here's one hypothetical example in our game you have to pay two flow Mana in dragons to play an online version of beetle drive if you complete the whole Beetle you unlock a beetle as an in-game pet here's the rules for Beetle Drive

05:23:07	the body part drawn is decided by the role of a die you must draw the body before you can place any other part you can't place eyes or antenna until you've drawn the head in our version of beetle drive you can only roll the dice once an hour but players can sell a partially completed Beetle as an nft this would have value to another player because of the time flow and chance that has been invested to get it to that stage essentially paying money for a shortcut here's another example the mega fruit

05:23:35	tree normally a seed will grow into just one particular type of tree and it will only grow one type of fruit a person who specializes in gardening could create a tree that players can Harvest multiple types of fruit from this could be very valuable to other players who may not have a large Garden or may not be interested in the gardening aspect of dragons in the game you'll be able to create spells with a wide variety of uses the average player could be able to create a magical floating cloud that

05:24:04	Waters all their plants for one week ideal if you aren't interested in tending your garden each day but still want to harvest the special ingredients you need for cooking crafting Etc really focus on spell crafting and you may be able to make a magical floating cloud that waters for a whole month this could then be turned into an nft and sold to other players the list of possibilities goes on and on an important point to highlight is that the dragons creators don't benefit from the sale of nfts only

05:24:34	the person who puts in the time and effort to create the nft receives the funds from sales nfts really have huge potential and their complexity is only limited by what you can imagine I don't know I can imagine quite a bit in our game players have the ability to make something that nobody else can if they put in the time and effort we want to enable a cottage industry of bespoke products created using an individual player's particular trade skills these will then be able to be turned into nfts and be traded if the

05:25:03	player wishes so far this hasn't been done before because very few people are aware that it's it's even possible until the internet computer came around it just wasn't we believe that nfts will revolutionize the way you play games and one of the Pioneers will be dragons find us on Discord open chat or X for all the latest game updates how you guys doing today my name is Mike O'Neal and we're going to be diving into the unique world of the internet computer and party hats and why party hats on the internet computer is

05:25:36	extremely special and different so now with the original launch of party hats it was met with much drama in the IC community and any OG who's followed knows that but the beautiful thing is we were all drawn to the Allure of the concept right because there's value in the party hats themselves so party hats has plans to actually build out a game and add utility which is extremely important but as a standalone asset there's value in the [Music] idea these aren't just regular FTS the whole purpose of this collection is to

05:26:11	re-envision what it's like to have a virtual collectible item in your wallet on the internet computer now let's talk a little bit about the historical roots and the inspiration of party hats now they're drawing on the Nostalgia from the runes gate party from 2001 the Christmas party where they just threw the hats up everywhere and that's kind of where the idea came which is actually really important because these items went from being paper hats to being a significant value of wealth for people who actually

05:26:37	accumulated them and held on to them which is very important The Collection has about 50 different hats right you have your wind Doge hat which happens to be uh you know a project within the ICP ecosystem you have your Donald Trump hat which a lot of people can tie to because they like it but the beautiful part about these hats is that they're nonf fungible therefore you're able to put this canister up into a game so if party hats wanted to make a game in the future wink wink they can literally take the

05:27:03	hats and put in aore around it to build a game around the hats to give them utility even though they're Standalone asset so let's talk a little bit about open world game integration right this is led by innovators such as Crow and Theo and party hats are Central to an open world game concept right and the most important thing is they're trying to blend elements of crypto gaming meme culture which all enhances their utility and player engagement so in the video before this one you got to see a lot about

05:27:33	non-fungible assets and the benefits of putting those non-fungible assets on the internet computer computer versus other blockchains where it might be held in the Amazon web services you own what you create and you can bring utility to it so I'm extremely excited about party hats and with Theo and Crow are going to continue to build into the future and the most important thing that I care about is watching guiding helping and building alongside of them Crow happens to be a good friend of mine as is Theo

05:27:59	so that's enough of party hats so now let's talk about clown and what I'm building but before I do I just have to get a little clownish and put my clown nose on on here now with clowns building is fungible it's the backbone of our community it's an aect that allows people to give value to people you see we have four types of people that come to the clown we have content creators we have marketers we have VF developers and most importantly we have project leads we're looking to get people into the Eco in any which way we

05:28:33	can and value them for bringing their Collective passions to this organization so let's start from the top we have our content creators our content creators are always there trading content means digital art banners any which way they to use their passion to push their circus as a whole then we have our marketers and our marketers are constantly going on Twitter going in spaces going everywhere they can to share what the circus is build then we have the important part which is the developers right the developers are here

05:29:03	to build these D apps for the community so if you have an idea maybe you don't know how to create it but you're a designer will not even need someone that knows the com and the developers and lastly we have the project leads now the project leads are very important because they have everything put together and they're just here for the circus marketing as a whole it all comes together at the surface now our community thrives on engagement whether it's on X whether it's on Discord whether it's on telegram or the place we

05:29:30	actually want to all come home to which is web 3 catalyze catalyze is this amazing social platform the social file and what they're building over there is super special So eventually we plan on onboarding everybody from web 2 to web 3 they get them familiar with the platform now the fungible clown token stands at the epicenter of all this allowing us to Value the contributions from our members now the difference with clown to was it was a complete community coin this was launched from the community by the

05:29:58	community and the community owns it now we plan on making a new coin called tickets which works as the utility point now we have these Grand plans for a circus arcade in the future and which you can come into and play your spend your tickets to have a good time now by doing this it enhances the value of a very vious Community allowing everyone to be valued for their contur and that's extremely important when you're building a circus so only do have our circus arcade we have all types of games flat

05:30:24	like a number one clown who's going to flip a coin or any arcade game that you get and the whole purpose we're doing here is to let you know that when you go to an arcade you spend hundreds of dollars Hing in your kids for yourself and you walk away with a stuffed animal so the whole purpose of that utility is is to drive engagement and to drive value from our core coin that's a friends to all together we have the clown coin as a brand and we have clown tickets as utility runting all working with top developers in the Eco guys that

05:30:50	are built for every major SNS on that platform and in that computer our nns which is very important now one of the main people building here is building a bank of canisters for the circus so that we can do this the right way and give you guys the ability to have fun while they all sit and wait for everyone to come to our ego so now I just want to talk a little a little bit more about our rewarding system this where a Fung will talk you so there's an Open Marketplace that allows you to swap so there's value behind the court essence

05:31:15	of the circuits right so our content creators get rewarded our developers get rewarded our marketers get rewarded and our project leads get rewarded are getting the marketing of the whole circus so our content creators might make means for a new project coming on board and as long as we see potential in the project we plan on helping the community become aware of it don't forget why this segment is running to go to your gotic airdrop and get your gets fin now if I can drive you to one place it will be our Discord for now that's

05:31:42	out web 2 onboarding station we plan on building out everything we're doing there and more on catalyze in the future but right now is a place for you to earn to learn cuz our whole concept here at the Cirus is wisdom through entertainment we want to entertain you and educate you on app Eco who's in app Eco what collections are on our Eco the difference between fungible and non-fungible and the power of blockchain so now coming full Circle you've seen on the original segment what party hats a nonf fungible asset can do in terms of

05:32:14	utility now we're showing you clown what we're doing right now by showing you how we're giving utility and value to our members now I got to hit home one more time contact cre years marketers developers and project weeks that's who we're looking for so now let's get this those off and let's get to the conclusion here and why this is extremely important for the internet computer fungible non andity and let's move into the last segment here which I'm going to let my friend sh Gates himself explain it but

05:32:45	before I do I have to explain the importance here that these things we're talking about are not something for tomorrow they're happening right now and my good friend who built L Doge I don't want to get ahead of his Alpha in what he's about to tell you but he's actually built a decentralized application in which his fungible token is getting utility right now so that's out of me and my clown energy so now MC take it [Music] away all right we are back and I hope you caught that clown air drop right

05:33:30	there and as you can see we have a lot of great Community projects here building on ICP and I here we have a a project that's going to de something they have special for you in a metaverse so let's tune into that welcome to icx a decentralized social network currently being developed on the internet computer blockchain integrating Advanced AI features icx is governed by a dow which empowers its users by giving them ownership of their data and control over the algorithms and privacy settings this

05:34:02	user Centric approach ensures that participants play a significant role in the governance and evolution of the network making icx a community-driven platform where privacy and data ownership are prioritized Additionally the app will be open- sourced facilitating forks and further customization our Dow is unique on the internet computer as it grants you direct access to the ICP treasury allowing you to exchange icx tokens and neurons for ICP at your convenience this feature supports minority opinions by

05:34:34	providing an option to exit the Dow if there are disagreements with the majorities decisions moreover our platform maintains zero inflation and every modification to the DAP requires Dao approval in icx you will be able to follow friends make posts share images and create tokenized polls or prediction markets mixing features of social networks like Twitter with crypto Primitives and as if that weren't enough we will harness the unique capabilities of the internet computer to run AIS as smart contracts thereby bringing web 3

05:35:09	AI and social networking closer together we will enhance your social interactions with Advanced AI features including AI clones summaries translations and more AI will enable us to create a social network where truth and knowledge abound and where misinformation and toxicity are eliminated follow us on Twitter at I6 Dow and visit our website at ix. one what's up ipcc it's your favorite dogcoin CEO here sh Gates we're going to be taking a look at Windows 98 now so I started Windows 98 back in November and

05:35:43	since then we've grown to over 10,000 wallets and we're now the number two meme coin on the IC by market cap we also released our first app and all of our websites and everything is hosted on chain so we'll take a look at that here in a second let's get started so the first thing you're likely to stumble upon is the landing page here and this looks like just any normal website on web to but this is in fact hosted inside of ICP canisters here you can also find information like some ads from our friends here uh where to trade and then

05:36:19	live tokenomics stats so all these stats here are pulled from ACH canister and R live you can also view our white paper and you can check out some of our friends here and social media links but let's get into some of the more fun stuff now so on that landing page in the top right corner as soon as you arrive you get hit this Bo desktop button and we're back in 1998 now so you get presented with the startup menu here you can select either option it doesn't matter they both take you to the same place so after selecting one you'll be

05:36:50	taken to the desktop and you'll immediately notice some windows you'll see some dog verts uh those come from one of our daps that's also all hosted on chain this desktop here is also all hosted on chain it's all on chain also anything that opens inside of a window with within this desktop is also an ICP D so for instance we have tagger here we have open FPL you can play some fantasy football you can access the different dexas like ICP Swap and Sonic basically we could drop whatever dabs we want in here um I'm not going to

05:37:27	go through them all you guys could go visit the website and check all this stuff out for yourself I don't want to ruin the fun but uh one of the intentions I had when I made this coin was to make it serve as sort of a portal into the IC and I wanted to do that in a unique way and the users of IC have just really ran with it I mean we have hundreds of gigabytes of memes at this point it's insane so like I said I'm not going to go over everything here I'll leave some of it up to you guys and you guys could

05:37:57	go play with this and have some fun so now we'll hop on over to our first app real quick dog Advertiser and with dog Advertiser is it just allows you to create advertisements and those advertisements are displayed on our main landing page and in those pop-up windows that you all saw earlier on the desktop so on dog Advertiser you could sign in with your internet identity and it generates a wallet for you and you can deposit some exe and start making some ads you will own so the ad creation is pretty simple uh it's just looking

05:38:29	for a 250X 250 pixel image and then the fee to create the ad you are burning 10 exe to create it oh that is nice you can also boost it by burning more exe if you take a look at all the ads here you'll see that the top burn is now a little over 300 exe so a little over $150 and that just means that they're more likely to come up in those different popups or near the first results of the ones that are showed on our landing page and we have some other stuff in the works I'm not going to spoil anything but we will

05:39:02	be integrating these different ads into other stuff we make in the future as well soe Andy I'll go ahead and stop here like I said if you guys are interested you could head to Windows 98.com you can also follow me on Twitter my user name is shill gaty s h i l l g a t s y and window on Twitter is windows98 so now let's head over to the yuku metaverse and see what the happenings are over there all right all right all right world so we are in The Meta web 2 when switch my avatar up I want to have a

05:39:39	little fat guy if I want actually no I want to have I like the Tesla bot but I'm going to stick with this dude with this skin all right so now we're gonna go up to the stage here who's jumping around we got Crow jumping everywhere that's cool that's cool Crow I'll chase you Crow from party [Music] hats it's all right Crow from party hats now we have personal Dow you have space a [Music] and only crypto sitting hanging out they they wanted to come and check this out and we got Mr shill Gates here sitting in the sitting in the chair

05:40:17	okay he's he's just hanging out and really quick we're gonna play his D app in web in web 3 okay so right now we're going to share the screen and we're g to actually share his D app okay and now on his web 3D app let me just get the angle perf perfect Crow stop running around can you come up here so we get the party hat on your head please get over here Crow sit down sit down sit down please I love you you can stand that's cool all right so now we have here we go all right now let's check out Mr Shield Gates and what he

05:40:54	built on web 3 so just so you understand what's going on we are in a web 3 metaverse and on top of the web 3 metaverse we're sharing a screen in the web 3D app to get utility so this is his moonlander game that he built and it's pretty dope okay I mean I'm not one for kind of games like this but I did get addicted and I do try to beat high scores but this is just a demo to show you so you know I'm going to kind of exit out you you get the idea it's pretty simple and a lot of people don't realize this but uh web 3 met is already

05:41:28	here so take it with you will we did the best that we could we hope you come back into ICP web3 meta [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right we are now back I just want to thank you all for tuning in with us so far we're approaching that 6-h hour mark in uh we're going to be having some panels coming in soon but that's still a bit out um I just want to remind you all that uh you know keep participating in the meme contest uh pcpcc is going to be giving out 10 ICP to the best meme and then uh keep your eyes out for more air

05:42:25	drops they're definitely coming up again as I mentioned earlier we're doing over 100,000 in airdrops and you know next we're going to hear from aoco boot camp graduate and then go into two clips from some of our sponsors bionic and Nuance so make sure you check those out hello everyone my name is riat habas and I am from Austria I'm a software developer so I came across um the Moto boot camp by accident I was searching for tutorials on Moto and I thought to myself this boot camp is a great opportunity to get

05:43:05	started uh I enjoyed my time during the boot camp I learned the basics of MCO development and met many uh interesting and great people uh yeah during my time I built my website it's a small website the landing page um you can see a representation kind of simulation of the blockchain and about my About Me section my services section and a small contact me form so if you also want to learn MCO development come and join the Moto boot [Music] camp bionic is an ordinal Marketplace and launch pad that we've been building

05:44:03	on the internet computer protocol nfts on bitcoin have been all the rage they've done over $2 billion in volume over the last 12 months and we're seeing people actually starting to build on bitcoin again and we've you know taken the advantage of the Integrations you know tcdsa subnet ability to read and write directly to bitcoin the ckbc token on on ICP we built bionic as an ordinal Marketplace leveraging all of that Tech so you can trade ordinals at the speed and cost of ICP rather than the speed

05:44:32	and cost of bitcoin along with that we have all the other advantages of being built on a Bitcoin side chain fast transactions no gas fees or network fees for users really easy onboard experience and a lot of flexible tooling for creators and [Music] [Music] collectors I'm Nick I'm the founder of aen we are a blockchain software development company based here in the Netherlands and we're a major contributor to the Nuance publishing platform Nuance is an entirely onchain publishing platform it applies the

05:45:12	benefits of web 3 to a medium style hosting platform the big thing about Nuance is that it is governed by its users our big differentiator from the platforms like medium Etc is that writers own and govern the platform upon which they contribute content a very big deal I think for a lot of writers out there because it minimizes platform risk in traditional online publishing platforms can change the rules with their own decisions from a centralized CEO or a centralized team but on Nuance all of these decisions are in the hands

05:45:46	of the users the goals of the Nuance Community are based around three core elements to have the fairest paid writers on the internet it is to be the most trusted platform for long form content on the internet and we want to have the best e works of both readers and writers always making our proposals to the Nuance community based around those three core pillars on Nuance we we have a set of features called Publications and Publications allows teams to have their own presence on Nuance a publication has its own landing

05:46:15	page its own search its own user management it has a basic article workflow like an approval workflow and has the capability to publish premium articles behind an nft gated paywall we think any respectable crypto project should be publishing their long form content on web 3 we see many web 3 projects publishing their long form content on Web Two platforms like medium this doesn't seem very bullish on web 3 we understand that the web two platforms have the audience which is why over the coming months we are providing a conci

05:46:48	edge service for teams to help them build their web three audience on web 3 as part of our work for the Nuance style we will create a publication post content on your behalf for free the only catch when the team shares the content of the social platforms they use the Nuance link Nuance has a very simple tokenomics to help overcome the cold St problem and that is to subsidize writers via dispersing tokens to readers by doing this we let the readers decide which content gets rewarded as part of our next proposal to the new on

05:47:22	community hope to implement our foret whereby our user can disperse up to 50 newer tokens per week the tokens from the foret are restricted in the sense that they can only be used on nuance and once they're used on Nuance for tipping or buying premium content and they're received by the writer they are liquid newer tokens and can be transferred or used for governance so if you want to have your own presence on web 3 and start to build your web 3 audience contact us today to set up your publication Nuance XYZ is the platform

05:47:55	and you can contact us on Twitter Discord or open chat [Music] I'm RAR quenta I'm the CEO and the founder of The catalyzed Da we have catalyzed believe in community and in web 3 Community is very important and it's also a very hard job to do we're very sensitive to the reality of managing and growing the community so we built the catalyze platform which is now a dow to enable groups of all sizes to grow and cultivate their membership and do all of this for the most part on chain so they can have the security and

05:48:45	unstoppables of blockchain the risk of censorship being eliminated and allow their communities to grow in a very organic way and we felt that it was important to build such a platform when most you know web 3 communities are using tools like Discord and others which have issues around sensorship and control and personal data ownership that we thought would hold back Community growth again especially ESP we3 space and so we think cataly Dow is is well positioned to uh meet those needs all right we are back ICP and you

05:49:22	know I just want to give a quick shout out to all of the sponsors that were just in the previous ads there uh real quick we do have another influencer SWAT coming up and it's going to be from our very own uh Bobby O who's an ICP OG he's been doing a lot of great content uh as as well as do hosting a lot of spaces recently he's got a great interview coming up with Mike Schwarz and uh we should get into that CU it's going to be a pretty great film uh interview I should say but yeah let's get into that right

05:49:50	[Music] now so Mike thank you so much for joining us today for anybody who's watching the live stream my name is Bobby I'm just a regular content creator I'm an ICP fanatic and I'm a big origin bull as well just full transparency so I'm going to be interviewing Mike from origin today and he's going to be talking a little bit about the origin foundation and the technology behind it the problem that they're solving I want to take it on over to Mike as quickly as possible here so he can talk and educate

05:50:23	everybody on Origin foundation without further Ado Mike I'm going to go ahead and kick it over to you sure great to see you Bobby uh thanks for having me and uh thanks for all the great work you've been doing origin has come about as a result of uh really a vision mission that transpired as long ago as 2015 pretty Broad and ambitious Vision to migrate Global Commerce to what we would now think of as open to centralized infrastructure you know first of all we needed a base level protocol that was going to accommodate

05:50:50	such a migration and we all know and love the internet computer it is really an extraordinary differentiator and really the only feasible means of migrating kind of volume and scale and performance um in Industry I was running around the world years ago with the likes of Dominic and trying to get this going and all credit to Dom has built this extraordinary team who' now created this incredible protocol but in in terms of that ambition to migrate industry as far back as 2016 we thought that what we

05:51:18	now think of as real world assets was a good place to start so we started to work with the likes of the diamond industry back then first built first incarnation of Tracer which was to track the Providence of diamonds that was a great start but we were building on earlier releases of protocols like ethereum back then and we experienced firsthand problems around SC availability in performance and the lack of a built-in governance mechanism which really thwarted the platform's ability to really Blossom so origin was kind of

05:51:45	created to really materialize solutions for real world assets that could be deployed to leverage the internet computer and do that at scale with performance and built-in governance and all those good things and to now be multichain to do it in a green way that was cost effective so origin was created to take advantage of those extraordinary properties it's really interesting that few projects in the world outside of the community have really um figured out that this infrastructure is there to be

05:52:10	used but it creates incredible opportunities because it means that competitors just cannot compete so origin has been doing that work again in gemstones with fractionalized art recently obviously powering the gold Dow so those projects have been um really fruitful and successful been great proof points other things like goods made 100% in country countries like Italy and there's other countries interested in those Solutions as well a bit of a bit of work in luxury and Watchers so lots of exciting ing different projects with

05:52:38	different Industries but that's 9 years 2015 to now and there's been an incredible amount of learning along the way bouncing off the walls a few times as you'd expect loads of very very smart people from all next to the woods in this community working together to make this happen final evolution of the model which is a really important one Global gdps I think I think it's tipped over 100 trillion now that's the size of the the prize we're talking about here to carve off chunks of that1 trillion GDP

05:53:04	when we say migrate Global Commerce to this new INF structure that's the size of the price so the final layer in the stack organizationally now is to create something like pan industrial and have other integrators like pan industrial that can be for-profit work with large industry to plug them into the likes of origin in the internet computer and that's a scalable model that should work forever especially as more integrators join the freight and I think what's more exciting than anything in the last 9

05:53:30	months I'd say big industry has really started to show up I don't think people are seeing this but I can tell you what happening my hand on my heart is happening you know these are multi-year projects most of them they involve you know agreements where often the industry plays involved retain the right to discuss and release PR releases and so forth as And when they see fit not as and when we see fit so you know sometimes people ask me who who you working with now what's going on now I can tell you the industries I can tell

05:53:58	you the projects but I'm not Li Liberty to tell you every organization's name but you know after 9 years of work maybe we can all wait another 9 months to find out who they all are that was great Mike I really appreciate it just looking out you know you talked a little bit about you know pan industrial and where everything is going with the origin Foundation if you could just whatever you can share I know you're limited because you know you work with a lot of Institutions and that's primarily what

05:54:23	your solution is your solution is more so targeting the institutional space What are some things on the horizon with origin and pan industrial that you could share with our viewers I mentioned gemstones which is where we started there's more work going on with gemston that will involve minting many many carrots of stones there's that in country work that I mentioned earlier where we have organizations that are certified as producing Goods that are 100% made in country such as you know a bottle of olive oil not only the oil has

05:54:51	come from a tree in the country but also the glass bottle was manufactured in the country and therefore the entire product is certified as 100% made in country and that's a big problem for these producer countries where there's there's counterfeiting of all sorts of goods and services now including oil more countries interested in that sort of work obviously we've powered the gold Dow which is a pretty revolutionary product a relationship with metalor a huge Refinery and smelting organization in Europe KPMG audits the viewers here

05:55:21	may or may not know that those NTS can be locked in Dow gold tokens in that Dow is now Community governed and next step is a stable coin backed by gold in again in perpetuity through that chain of custody moving on to some of the large industry plays we're doing some work with taxation a great use case for origin and the IC around carbon offsets another platform around lending this one I can talk a little bit more about we're working with at the moment we have over 20 organizations at the table that

05:55:50	involves the tokenization of things like mortgages which then allows the ready uh fractionalization of those instruments we're in talks with insurance at the moment textiles and Fashion sports financing some use cases around player transfer fees potentially also fractionalizing those and giving the fans access just recently in the last couple of weeks some big opportunities with pharmaceutical companies and particularly in around things like clinical trials so we can anonymize data pull it make it available to research

05:56:19	teams where they all get uh much broader access to to data that helps them with their research and of course AI has a great role to play there too there are others but there's a spattering of of pretty exciting things first three that I mentioned there are in fact underway and and if you could just for for the viewers and for people who maybe they haven't looked into real world assets or the problem that's being solved here and a lot of the issues that those Industries have had just in years past

05:56:45	yeah it's it's really interesting the shifts that are occurring which we all suspected should occur around what consumers do and don't care about there's a couple of angles here the first one is are things sourced created sustainably and ethically that's mattering more you know I was speaking to my son the other day and said hey should we go buy some clothes where would you like to get your clothes he said I'd like to go to Patagonia and I said oh really okay cool he said yeah yeah I like I like what they stand for I

05:57:11	like what the what the owner's done and I and I like where the money's going and uh you know it means something to me and so that's where that's where I want to buy my clothes you know there's a generation that's really making purchasing decisions now based upon these things and they're all getting jobs and they're all earning money you've got an organization like De Beers or or anyone else as opposed to synthetic diamonds pulling real diamonds out of the ground lots of Suspicion and criticism over many decades about where

05:57:36	they were coming from was a local economy benefiting enough um where the workers being exploited even blood diamonds all that stuff you know not no doubt some of the criticisms were warranted at different points in time the organization's gone to enormous lengths to almost over address some of those past issues to the extent that you know there's clear data that um the residents of Botswana have that you know there's been incredible influx of of funding into into the country in terms of making education free Transportation paved

05:58:10	roads education free quality of life's gone up enormously the economies improved bana's one of the success stories of Africa and they've renegotiated the deal again recently I think they've done better again being able to show where a diamond came out of the ground and to create that digital twin at the head of the value chain and then have that value chain track track all the way through to the extent that perhaps you know as it's cut and Polished it's split into a number of child Twins or any FS perhaps some of

05:58:37	those are recombined into a a new parent as a piece of jewelry is made so now instead of feeling guilty when I look at a diamond ring on my finger that's a wedding ring um now I can look at it and I can know beyond doubt that that purchase actually represents improving the lives of many thousands of people let's take a look at the watch industry also today a lot of Watches or increasing number of watches uh bought and sold online through marketplaces buyers and sellers both have issues there buyers are worried that they're

05:59:11	going to get an authentic good that they're actually getting what they think they're getting and and sellers are hoping they're going to get their cash when they part with their precious watch if we can have a digital twin of a watch that contains data so data attributes high resolution videos images 3D volumetric videos that can irrefutably identify that watch or another similar item for that matter when we have the sellup putting that up for sale and that digital tweener companies the watch then

05:59:40	the buyer can deposit their money in digital escrow on chain and then the watch can be sent um through a third authorized third party who can make sure that that is in fact the watch it's supposed to be once that's released to the to the uh buyer then the money is released from digital escrow for each asset class there are different considerations about how you uniquely identify the object watches are actually a particularly difficult subject you got the movement inside do you know if somebody's opened it up and changed

06:00:10	something inside even though the outside might look okay we've we've actually determined ways to get on top of those problems um so we can store data inside a twin now that can even guarantee the moov side for 65% of the world's Watchers some really really interesting tricks about whether DET detecting whether the watch has been opened since it's been made or since it's been to an authorized service center so if it hasn't been opened then you know that the the movement inside is genuine also if it has been opened and it's been

06:00:43	opened by an authorized service center then they'll remint the data that's required to um detect if it's if it's ever opened after it leaves their hands right so there's all sorts of really interesting techniques that can be used to embed all that information inside the digital twin or the nft now of course that's why it's important that a lay on protocol can handle so much data to store hundreds of gigabytes of data inside an nft entirely on chain in web canister at a fraction of the cost of any other solution again is an enormous

06:01:14	competitive advantage and it's essential to the immutability and irrefutability of that nft and the robustness of the solution that's great Mike I really appreciate it I talked to my brother not too long ago and you know he purchased a diamond ring for his now wife and you know he told me that he got the diamond ring and he got the certification for the diamond ring via a email PDF which could be reproduced a thousand times over again and somebody could technically just steal that diamond ring go sell it on the black market but you

06:01:48	know once Solutions like this are implemented across those Industries I mean I I just it's hard to imagine how much that's going to change things um just with knowing something is authentic preventing theft in the future I'm really glad you raised that Bobby it's a it's a fantastic point we can highlight the value of origin on the IC here so you just mentioned a paper PDF obviously it can be separable from the item it can be photocopied and changed and whatever else altered modified when we do what

06:02:19	we're talking about here with a twin an NT on this infrastructure stack not only can we have the data that uniquely identifies the item and mut irrefutably but because we can store so much data inside our nft remember we're talking hundreds of gigabytes here and no one else can do that no other Tech stack can do that on chain proper web 3 again that competitive Advantage so when you're going to Industry and you can solve some of these age-old problems for them on one hand and on the other hand you say

06:02:52	how would you like some new growth corridors some more revenue streams on top of that with this instrument we can embed data logic user interfaces inside the nft in fact an entire microplace dap inside the nft on this stack again totally unique in the world this solution I can put inside there or an industry partner can all sorts of other value added Services which they can upsell which might be Insurance warranties service records bequal data Heritage data um lost and stolen alerts so I can tag if if I I think I've lost

06:03:28	my ring or maybe it's been stolen I can tag it just like like a credit card I can tag it as it's gone right it's mine but I don't know where it is right so if that shows up anywhere as you said Bobby if the certificate becomes Central to the trading of these items globally if it's tagged by Tona as now lost or stolen and it shows up anywhere in any Marketplace or any value chain then there's there can be no denying the fact number one either the CER is the certificate there yes or no if no we've

06:04:01	got a problem if yes and the lost or stol on alert is checked yes uh and no one can change that except the owner then clearly there's a problem there too right so all of this is um on on one side we're solving problems around counterfeiting and theft and all that stuff and on the other side we're giving Industries more valuated services for upselling it'll make the whole industry better for everybody real the real value producers the manufacturers um who will no longer see counterfeits cannibalizing their

06:04:35	business business and of course the consumers who value the scarcity and perhaps the heritage of of what it is they're buying um and being absolutely being able to be absolutely certain about that just as an aside you look at there's a photograph there I took that with my with this phone actually that's an automized Pig watch and that's the macro lens on um on this phone of course we we all want uh automated matching to occur um with some asset classes that's easier than others but at at a bare

06:05:09	minimum MVP product if you can just see it with your eyes you don't need to be an expert if that watch is sitting in front of you you'll be able to tell if that's the same watch MVP is is good enough for any human on the planet to do to match um we're just going to get it more and more automated as time goes on so when you're looking out like over the next five years U not just with origin but also with ICP and with the industry as a whole you know where do you see us in five years from now and if you could

06:05:42	just talk about maybe some of the challenges in getting there but then also a lot of the opportunities um because everything that we've discussed and just on a daily basis when I'm doing my research on Origin or ICP that's all I see is just endless opportunities as far as the ey can see so if you could just give us you know like the next five years kind of what you see coming it's a bold statement I really think you'll see every industry having pan industry platforms what do I mean by that I mean

06:06:09	platform systems that different actors in each industry plug into throughout a value chain much more likely to be open sourced than closed certainly going to be decentralized and tamperproof they'll get more comfortable with Dows that's going to take a little while at at industry scale we've already got conversations on a couple of those platforms genuinely considering Dows even at the industry level you'll have still have some private chain implementations that'll be a progress that just happens naturally you know

06:06:37	hopefully things like Utopia will will help accelerate that um but all of those things are I think almost guaranteed at this point you know we all know that the vast majority of solutions very little is on chain if it's not running on the IC it's it's barely web 3 it's running on big Tech servers the performance is not typically there you've seen it Bobby you look at the criteria across a chart with 10 10 columns on it and the IC wins every category all this stuff has to matter now cuz we're getting these

06:07:06	industry plays running they have to do a Bonafide assessment some of them have been a bit burned by experimenting with other choices but even those that that have been burned now saying okay so we need to we need to have a good set of criteria here we need to do some good analysis and actually check things off and see if if they really do what we need them to do there's sort of a level of understanding now amongst industry that they can sort of make those assessments more astutely which is great

06:07:32	for all of us yes I I'm 100% with you on that and it would be nice for there to be more conversations in the space about like real technology that's solving real problems in all reality just with ICP and with origin the these are trillion dollar markets trillion dollar problems these are some of the biggest problems that exist out there today and if there's viable Solutions right now in their infancy all attention and focus should be covering those and educating the general public on what these

06:08:02	Solutions are and the problem that they're going to solve just with the time that we have left I just kind of wanted to leave this open um anything else that you would like to share with the audience just about origin or pan industrial we now have the stack when I say we I mean all of us these are open open protocols and they're tokenized and they're governed by by Dallas and community members and token molders been waiting a long time been we've been building for a long time we've been pitching for a long time we've been

06:08:28	trying for a long time it's just go time I just encourage anybody who's listening to jump on the stack you know it's our stack after all and and we can create these incredible solutions for Global Commerce for society and business and government we will improve the world doing this we're coming off a low Baseline the systems we have today you know trust is and short suppliers as we often say right and the impact that that can have on the world is absolutely immense if we all were using wholly trustworthy systems all the time half

06:08:56	the world's problems would disappear overnight we just need to pile on together here now if you haven't been involved in this community to date the IC or origin or or the rest of the stack just start don't defend an inferior product or stack do a criteria based assessment the substance will win because industry needs it to work and it can only work on substance and I wholeheartedly believe just like web 1 and web 2 Big Industry is really the decisive Factor when Big Industry turns up to play that version of web becomes

06:09:25	huge and successful Mike I really appreciate it thank you so much for your time today and I strongly encourage anybody watching this live stream to do your own research on you know on origin and on IC P that was what did it for me um going through and looking at real criteria and finding technologies that solve real problems like origin so I'm thrilled to you know see the future um of origin play out over the next few years and excited to see everything you have coming moving forward [Music] [Music]

06:10:13	if you want to dive into nft projects which are running on IC nft geek can be your best friend it Aggregates data from all nft marketplaces which run on IC it has ton of analytics and charts about holders about meting about transactions about unique wallets and so on and so forth also has a realtime feed and you can snipe some good nfts right when they appear for nft creators it has snapshot tool which can help them to create a list of loyal holders for Rewards or air drops it also has portfolio feature

06:10:48	where you can monitor your spendings or [Music] earnings all right ICP we are back and that was just another like that was a great interview from Bobby O uh we're about 6 hours and 15 minutes in to the pcpcc 2024 and I just want to remind you all to keep uh liking and sharing the link here so that we get more Awareness on ICP and the ICPC and I do want to give a quick reminder too that May 11th so tomorrow we're going to be having the iccc SNS Dow uh in the SNS Launchpad so if you want to participate that starts

06:11:27	at, 1500 UTC and I just want to give another reminder for that that with the first 880,000 I CP raised there's going to be a multiplier reward for those that participate early so if you want to participate make sure you're active and early on so you can get some extra benefits so again I just want to say shout out to Bobby O it was a great interview with Mike Schwarz of origin and now we're going to do another influencer highlight of K crypto and we're going to go into that video right now the internet computer has to be one

06:12:05	of the most hated projects in crypto but does it deserve that hate in this video I'll be going through all the major fud points people have about ICP and comparing it to its biggest competitors if you don't know who I am I am K crypto on YouTube be sure to subscribe if you like these types of videos the number one point of fud the internet computer has is that it is just centralized garbage and that's because a lot of people say that you can't run a node if you're a normal person as the network

06:12:30	only allows for data centers to run nodes and they're not actually wrong you do need to be a massive data center to become a node on the internet computer but that doesn't mean it is completely useless and centralized garbage in fact the actual point of the internet computer is to serve purposes that very decentralized blockchains like ethereum con already do a lot of haters for the internet computer and also a lot of community members who just don't understand how it works keep comparing ethereum to the internet computer when

06:13:00	it comes to scale and decentralization take it from the CEO of the internet computer Dominic Williams when he says the internet computer is not and was never intended to be nor has ever been sold as an ethereum killer ethereum and the internet computer are different beasts which derives from their respective focuses you cannot transform one into the other owing to technical considerations they are different by Design but very complimentary not competitive the internet computer is hosted by special node machines run by

06:13:29	independent nde providers in independent data centers around the world by contrast anyone can create a do making ethereum node using a graphics card and the key here that a lot of people are missing is that you need both ethereum and the internet computer to create the full web 3 stack so ethereum is very good for the mission critical part of a decentralized application so when it comes to UNI swap the actual smart contracts that do the swapping of the tokens etherum can do that just fine especially now that leer 2's are out and

06:13:58	they are helping to scale ethereum but because ethereum is still insanely focused on building a decentralized platform they simply can't do things that involve more storage and more computation than those simple applications for example once again you just can't create a decentralized website on top of ethereum so all the ethereum applications are having to use centralized websites you can't use ethereum to do massive computations for things like AI as well and that is basically just the use case of the

06:14:24	internet computer it comes in and fulfills all of those things that very very decentralized platforms like ethereum can't do and that is what a lot of people just don't get and what Dominic Williams was getting at in this medium post the internet computer was not designed to be as decentralized as ethereum it was designed to be a bit more centralized but in doing so add much more functionality and fill in those gaps that ethereum couldn't do such as hosting more decentralized websites Etc so I think of the internet

06:14:51	computer as sitting in between web 2 Amazon web services centralized applications and ethereum Bitcoin really decentralized chains it sits in the middle and then does the things that ethereum and Bitcoin can't do for it so the fud about the internet computer being centralized just doesn't make sense to me because it's clear it was never supposed to be as decentralized as ethereum the next big point of fud is the controversial launch of the ICP token which in my opinion is actually valid fud this is the initial token

06:15:21	distribution at launch and if you look closely 0.8% went to the public community 99.2% of the entire Supply went to handpicked insiders and this is very bad for any cryptocurrency project especially ones like the internet computer that have a governance system basically your entire governance system is now captured by insiders since they have enough tokens to just vote in whever they want to vote in the public SL Community has no say in it now there is a silver lining which is that the price of ICP has gone down a bunch and

06:15:54	it's already been out for 2 years so it is very possible in fact likely that a lot of those insiders sold a lot of their tokens during the last two years especially once again whilst prices were way higher than than they are today and if they did sell a lot of their tokens it could mean that the supply distribution between the public and insiders these days is a lot better not only that though but the circulating Supply compared to the total Supply is very very good A lot of these Newen projects like arbitrum SL optimism come

06:16:21	out with a very low circulating Supply and VCS and insiders just end up dumping on them and suppressing the price that can't really happen with the internet computer because most of the tokens are already tradable on top of that as well yes I'm not a fan of the centralized token nomics for a decentralized platform but honestly if you compare it to a lot of the platforms out these days this is salana token distribution it's not too different they're all coming out with centralized tokenomics and with

06:16:46	salana being number five in terms of market cap it's clear the market doesn't really care maybe longterm people will start caring about true decentralization but in the next one to two years as the bull market is coming along it seems like people just care about having a nice platform that's lightning fast that can do what they want it to do and that provides an amazing user experience which in my opinion the internet computer does do at the moment okay the internet computer versus its competitors

06:17:11	now yes the internet computer can do much more than salana you can actually do true Compu true storage on the internet computer that you can't do on salana you can build more complex applications on the internet computer but right now one of the biggest use cases is simply just having a nice user experience to trade meme coins on and yeah in that massive use case that we seeing at the moment in crypto salana is the number one competitor so if we do compare these stats real quick salana has an average of 5 Seconds to reach

06:17:37	finality with outliers going as far as 12 seconds and salana can do around 50,000 transactions per second Max in its current build if we do compare that to the internet computer there is no real TPS limit on the internet computer once again I just described how the internet computer can always just add more subnets and its finality is also way faster so it has a web speed finality of 2 seconds and the amount of blocks per second the internet computer has is pretty insane so salana has two .5 blocks per second the internet

06:18:07	computer has almost 10x at 22.5 out of all the major blockchains right here I do think the internet computer is basically the most scalable and the fastest now when it comes to 4 on dpin I believe the largest competitor the internet computer has right now is arweave and I recently did a video on arweave as they recently released a massive hyperparallel computer on top of their chain now R weave is very interesting because they found a way to do permanent in information storage you pay once and your data is never deleted

06:18:38	and currently the internet computer cannot do that and they also found a way to make their chain basically infinitely scalable when it comes to storage and TPS as well and they recently came out with this AO computer opdate that uses that infinitely scalable layer one to build an infinitely scalable World computer on top of it the general gist is because rwe has this infinitely scalable layer one what you can do is have computers perform tasks and then every now and then the important information from those tasks or

06:19:07	processes are sent to the r weave layer one to be stored and because that happens you can just verify whether or not the tasks were done correctly and because you can store basically an unlimited amount of information on top of R weave you can just have as many of these computers constantly sending information to the rwe layer one to verify their comput now this is very good because it allows for complete customization something that the internet computer doesn't currently allowed for so instead of enforcing one

06:19:31	set of choices upon all users of the Computing environment AO is buil in a modular form allowing users to choose which virtual machines they want sequencing models and message passing security guarantees and payment options work best for them but one big plus the internet computer does have is the amount of memory that are allowed for smart contracts so at the moment on R weave they are limited to about 4 GB of memory for contract storage the internet computer has a much higher roof for that meaning that for more data intensive

06:20:01	applications it could be better to use the internet computer the internet computer also has a bunch of nice features built in such as a custom HTTP Gateway which I believe once again allows you to easily just host your own decentralized websites another big Advantage internet computer has is Network effects it's already been out for years now it already has a strong ecoystem on top of it that is growing rapidly and those Network effects even if there are slight differences in the way AO and the internet computer work

06:20:28	might just be the key to winning this people may just choose to use the most popular platform instead of using a slightly different platform that is is less popular and on top of that because the internet computer is more matured AO is still I believe in beta it hasn't even been released yet then there's a decent chance this just works more smoothly than the AO framework they've probably worked out a bunch of the hiccups with the internet computer in the early days that the AO computer will probably start dealing with because once

06:20:52	again the AO computer is still in its early days so for a more well-rounded solution that works today I think the internet computer wins but in the long term I think the AO computer could be a pretty big competitor at least for certain types of applications especially if they do require permanent storage which once again AO computer offers natively via R we now another major dpin project is filecoin and shout out to Virtual bacon because he managed to get this chart right here which I think is very very amazing and he has one of the

06:21:22	best descriptions between all of these three major projects so definitely check out his videos if you haven't already this chart just goes to show as well the limitations of file coin so this is a bit outdated R weave technically has all four of these green just like the internet computer but filecoin the other major deepend project you can't really build true backends on top of it so filecoin is not a true full stack solution like a/r weave and like the internet computer so in my opinion it's already not really winning this race so

06:21:51	we've addressed the major fud points and we've compared it to its major competitors so does ICP deserve the hate that it currently has I don't think so the internet computer has a well-rounded solution and fills a very important niche in crypto which is completing the full web three stack and not only that but it does that a lot better than many of its competitors if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to my YouTube channel K crypto where I have a bunch of other altcoin videos thank you for

06:22:22	[Music] watching all right we are back ICP CCC and you know there another great video from K crypto there and uh we're getting a lot more people into Milwaukee here so I like if you hear something it's just people chatting so we're good um we do have our 23 locations going on around the world and you know as as I do mention that uh one of my longtime friends just proposed in Rome to his girlfriend Jen so I just want to congratulate him real quick while we're on stream uh but yes we have 23 locations going on across the world and

06:23:03	so many people are tuning in in so keep sharing our posts our Media Partners have been doing great uh we've had over 6,100 viewers from what I'm told and you know as we continue to do this don't forget about those memes keep doing the # ipcc 2024 keep those memes coming in and tag the pcpcc account we want to make sure that we get someone who has the best meme out there their 10 ICP and now we're going to go into a quick video from discover cyclops [Music] my name's YN I started my career working

06:23:44	for a startup in Vancouver BC where I was there for almost a decade until we got an exit from that company and then after that I spent probably three years just sort of as a Hired Gun I wanted to explore and jump between projects and sort of follow my interests and eventually that got me to Genesis on ICP what I am today is half of uh Cyclops with Byron and I'm still sort of jumping around between whatever project catches my interest hi I'm Byron Becker I live in the San Francisco Bay area and my

06:24:14	career background I started off at an education technology startup where I worked as a full stack engineer also worked at large companies like AWS where I worked as a software engineer on their connected smart vehicle platform then after that I took a little bit of time off and I found the internet computer it's a lot more fun than working at a big corpor company cyclop started when both Byron and I had a bunch of projects on the internet computer and we had this problem where we had to keep an eye on

06:24:43	all of these canisters so we had an opportunity to sort of drink our own wine and build a tool that we needed it was also something that a lot of people in the ecosystem needed as well so we built basically just something that would automate keeping your canisters topped up with gas and that was the start yur and I met in the IC developer Community Discord and it was just a way that that you know Kyle peacock or someone from the SDK team would come and show what's new in the SDK some of the new features what's being built out

06:25:13	people would ask questions and it was just a really great experience to meet other developers and Tackle problems our partnership and collaboration just sort of blossomed out of one of those calls the stickiest thing about ICP for me is like the engineering challenges are very fun and novel it's kind of the friends that you make along the way so I think the stickiest part of the Community is getting to know people and it has this sort of fun almost like Indie developer vibe to it um where you get to know

06:25:43	people and they jump around between projects and has a very very open and creative feeling in the community for somebody that likes their own freedom and likes being able to sort of build whatever project is the most interesting to them at that time the ICP Community just feels like a great place to be it's really just like a big open Green Field we want to build something it probably hasn't been built yet so go build it you know a lot of people are entrepreneurial and they want to build their own thing

06:26:10	and that's great and it's also frustrating cuz it's hard to find time to work with people you know everyone will then end up running into these same sets of problems by going through their own ways and that's where building infrastructure that can be shared and reused by a lot of different projects really comes into play and that's where we found a lot of value building Cyclops is people telling us the same thing that they need a cycles and canister management solution so we've started with Cycles at the core of our offering

06:26:42	because that's been the stickiest based off of the reverse gas model that the internet computer has and then we're starting to expand that into like a deeper canister management Suite that sort of Rivals what you would find in a in a web 2 monitoring solution one of the things that was sort of like the hook for our product really early on is the reverse gas model is awesome for consumers but um as a developer where it can become a bit of a pain as you have a bunch of canisters that you've built and

06:27:08	you have to remember to top them all up and if you don't obviously you can end up in a bad situation where your canisters freezing and we saw that happen with a bunch of projects in the early days and even to this day it's something that happens Cyclops just changes the model into a set and forget where if anything needs your attention we send you an email takes a lot of the pain away of dealing with your projects the IC protocol is evolving constantly and there's additional data that's being added really useful information to know

06:27:33	about your canisters things like query metrics and things like protocol built-in canister logging as those things are added to the protocol Cyclops is in a great position to follow along and take those and turn them into a great dashboard experience that Rivals what you would expect from any type of web 2 monitoring solution well if you're building projects on the internet computer go to Cyclops dodev start getting your canisters monitored and stop worrying about running out of Cycles [Music] Sol state is the first ICP native code

06:28:11	audit Security Agency there's no network out there like the internet computer and with all of the Power and leading new features that means that it's a new frontier for security considerations you need Auditors that have built daps on the internet computer before and to deeply understand how to navigate the security implications of the internet computer protocol our lead auditor David ales created the nns as well as the SNS the nns is the largest tvl platform within the protocol and it defines how

06:28:40	the protocol runs itself the SNS is a Launchpad that most dials within ecosystem launch on SOL state has done prss audits for leading def5 applications such as Sonic and IC decks so if you're building on the inter computer reach out to us today at solidate auditing dcom all right pcpcc we are back again and I just want to give a shout out out here because we have another massive influencer slot with us so here I'm pleased to announce that we have Wendy O for our next like crypto influencer slot

06:29:16	here for the iccc wendyo has over 370,000 followers and is a massive presence in the crypto space so shout out to Wendy O and we're looking forward to your video right [Music] now so hey Wendy it's great to have your time today thank you so so much yeah I just want to have a conversation about ICP and go into that topic you mentioned that you're a little new to ICP but um maybe we could start by you just sharing you know what do you know about ICP at this point so what I know about ICP at this point is part of like the whole FTX

06:29:49	debacle I had Dominic on my channel before there's a couple other ICP content creators I'm really close with like six fig really really good friend of mine we've talked about ICP before in the past and now I'm starting to get a lot of the ICP community members want to send me nft or kind of like you know get me more on boarded so I had made a post the other day like what's the best ICP wallet and I'm just kind of excited to learn more about it from you because that's how I learn is by talking to

06:30:16	people that are a lot smarter than me so I know it's like a layer one a blockchain you guys have nfts you have like a lot of building it's super techy but I want to know more ICP is a is a misunderstood blockchain because it is so different it kind of in my mind it fills a kind of a different layer of web 3 and that can make it hard understand cuz it's not based on ethereum where I like to start with it is a description of chain key technology have you heard the term chain key at all before or do

06:30:43	you have any familiarity with that no I don't explain it to me like I am a seven-year-old basically as you know with crypto um we all have these seed phrases that we use to have a key like a private key and we sign messages and that's how we make transactions on a theorum everything else so when you look at what an account is it's basically a secret that somebody knows that's actually like the first level of of security above that is something that you and a lot of others in we reply know it's called multii which is where you

06:31:12	have multiple people with their own secrets and they all come together to collectively sign what most people don't know is that there's a third level of security and this is the level of security that like government secrets are kept at and militaries keep their their secrets like it's the highest level of security that that's out there in the world it was invented in the 9s and it's called threshold cryptography the way that's different than multisig is you've got a node that each share a piece of a secret and without any one of

06:31:38	them ever reconstructing the full secret and knowing what it is they're able to collectively sign messages so it's kind of like nobody has that secret it's completely distributed amongst noes the problem is you can't really do this on a blockchain because you can't really trust the nodes that's the whole point of a trustless network the nodes might be malicious or they might be offline in Affinity hired like well over a 100 cryptographers more they have more cryptographers than any private organization other than governments and

06:32:03	there's nobody who has more cryptograph affinity and they worked for like eight years and they made the first version of threshold cryptography that could um work for the centralized Network and it's been in operation for 3 years so what we have here is the first Network that can use a secret that no human or computer will ever know smart contracts can now be decentralized web fre users like any other user and that's why people are excited about ICP is because they're able to basically add that

06:32:28	missing layer of of interoperability by directly being decentralized users on ethereum and Bitcoin and other now a lot of keywords in there but does that kind of generally make sense it kind of does like I feel I feel like the way you explained it it makes storing your priv like it makes because you know this the saying not your keys not your coins it makes that entire process a lot easier because let's face it one of the biggest problems with Bitcoin is that is cold storage and securing your keys properly

06:32:55	and I feel like that's a big problem we have for Mass adoption like we we we have so many people that are have lost their keys or they've not practiced good obac I feel like I see could potentially solve that I do want to ask you a little bit about the uiux like is it super easy for somebody that has no crypto experience to utilize like how talk to me about that a little bit like get convince me so yeah I mean once they invented chain key technology they reinvented a blockchain from the ground up using this new new tech right so uh

06:33:24	that's what makes ICP really different and really user friendly in fact one of the biggest criticisms people have had with ICP is that sometimes it doesn't feel web 3 flavored enough like our smart contracts are directly hosting websites we even have a project where it allows Google login so you go to a website that's like a social media website everything seems fast and responsive you log in with Google and you're like where's the web 3 and like you see little airdrop buttons and you can airdrop to to different posts and

06:33:49	stuff but it almost feels so easy to use and almost so indistinguishable from from web 3 that it can be a little suspicious at times when you don't know what's backing up the tech which is a fundamentally new form of cryptography it's not just a different flavor of evm or anything it's a fundamentally new type of construction and uh generally it has been really easy to use I think that what ICP has attracted a lot of is I call it the crypto curious crowd so there's a lot of people who have been

06:34:13	sitting on the sidelines of web 3 they believe in the ethos of why web 3 is created but they are looking for something they can really sink their teeth into that makes sense to them and there's a lot of like web 2 developers maybe front- end developers that kind of fit in this category right they've been following web 3 but they don't really actively engage that much because they've been waiting for for something that makes sense to them and icp's architecture has been really attractive to them that's why we've been on the top

06:34:34	starts for Builders we've had problems with certain dii U parameters in our ecosystem we've never had a problem with with attracting great Dev talent and getting Buns of nerds involved it's in a way I like that our ecosystem kind of takes web 3 back to its roots and just being like a bunch of nerds that are in in it for the tech right I think that that's great but one of the things that really kind of sparked my interest what you said is you're talking about a lot of web 2 devs coming over and I feel

06:34:56	like that's super important for adoption because when we talk about web 2 like web 2 is completely built out like the uiux is there it's there it's easy everybody's familiar with it so the fact that you guys are able to essentially garnish that crowd and get them to come over get them to build using ICP to me that speaks volumes because I'm like okay you have these really intelligent well-versed web 2 devs that see a crypto and they're like oh cool I can actually build on top of this so that means that

06:35:21	everything that's built utilizing ICP is going to have generally better uiux for Mass adoption to occur that's what I am getting out of this conversation thus far exactly exactly in fact to give you an idea of how much easier it is to build we have this onee boot camp where in one week they go from never having bu made a smart contract before in their life to deploying a dow that's able to control the code of an of a smart contract in just one week and the front end back end all of it's deployed and

06:35:50	live on chain basically like like JavaScript is the most common language that anybody knows how to build with there's probably I don't even know what the metric is probably 10x or or more JavaScript developers in the world than there are web 3 developers and you can build using typescript directly um on the internet computer uh so it's it's very easy for devs to get involved another big use case is Bitcoin you me you brought a Bitcoin earlier and how the whole use your keys things one thing that is a a centralized point in Bitcoin

06:36:16	is mining pools somebody somewhere has to have the keys to the account for a mining pool right uh not anymore there's a company called Loca Mining and they're building the first decentralized mining pool meaning that an ICP smart contract it has the secret key and no human or computer will ever know what that secret key is so it's a the centralized automated mining pool I'm curious like like what do you think about this type of integration so I'm sure you've heard of lots of different types of blockchains integrate with one another

06:36:42	so me personally I like like interoperability was such a buzzword way back when like in 2020 but now we're seeing actual interoperability take place like I think that that's absolutely crucial we have so many ecosystems in crypto and now we have all these layer ones competing we've got like ICP and Avalanche and salana and ethereum and whatever else so I think that interoperability is important especially if you're going to talk about game fire talk about like music NF or just talk about bringing networks and

06:37:06	communities together that have like let's say for example chain one doesn't have the use or utility that chain 2 has being able to bring those two together to essentially reap the benefits so I think that's a very interesting and awesome idea um me though I because I'm always a little bit weary of things as are being built out I kind of get in a little bit late and it's not because I don't believe in the project but I just want to make sure that it works properly and there's somebody a lot smarter than

06:37:28	I am essentially testing it and and making sure it's safe but I think it's really cool I like to see teams that are a team and projects and communities that are actually hitting um items on the road map that are just not stagnant and doing one thing I want to see things being actually built out and people actually using it so that's a big big thing for us is like valid utility but then again like just because you create your valid utility I want to make sure that it's easy to use because again I am

06:37:51	by far not a tech expert I don't want to be a tech expert I like to be in marketing I like to be verbal I like to explain these concept things I want to see things that are easy to use because if I can figure if I can't figure out how to use use your product then most of America is not going to be able to figure out how to use your product because I'm you know I got a little I'm a little techsavvy but if I can't figure it out they're not going to be able to for sure to get to the point of mass adoption you you really need to almost

06:38:16	be sneaky with it where someone's just using something because they find it useful and uh they they might not even know that it's running on web 3 like it's not until we get to that level where anybody can be getting value from web 3 whether they know what the centralization means or not you say you like to see projects that hit their road map and my mind I think one of the best examples that we have within our ecosystem is open chat um have you ever heard of open chat I have but refresh me it's basically like a fully

06:38:42	decentralized chat platform that's a little bit like telegram like a decentralized telegram it all runs in the browser and it's all done by smart contracts and it's got some web brief features built in it's upgradable in terms of they are adding new features all the time I think they're adding Google login literally next week it's also uh only upgradeable through the Dow so and all the token holders have to collectively vote on transparent proposals that then become the executing code of the DAP so if you kind of owned

06:39:09	a share of telegram's Base code and you know for a fact they can't add spyware or whatever because they have to publicly update their code looks and feels exactly like what people are used to like nothing's different like like you you could not even realize it's decentralized and just be using a normal chat app what do you think about ICP now that you've gotten a chance to be introduced to it I'm I'm actually very hopeful for you guys' future and I like the fact that web 2 developers are able to come over they're able to build and

06:39:33	bring their EXP over but I have a question for you before we go sure what is the best ICP wallet I should use cuz I've got some of your awesome community members that want to send me nfts and I just I need to get one so which wallet should I get I think plug plug is um is just a it's very easy and and it's very similar to metamask so if you're familiar with metamask and you just want a normal wallet that you're used to you know plug plugs got it there is another honorable mention called astrox they've

06:40:03	got a beautiful UI I think they're they're about to launch some really great smart wallet features that do some really impressive things but for just normal day-to-day use right right now what's ready and and easiest I think I think plug's the way to go awesome well thank you so much for educating me about ICP and I'm excited I'm going to get my wallet I'll post my public address and we'll see what little goodies I get and just so you guys know if you guys send me any nfts I don't sell any nfts um

06:40:28	that are gifted to me I take them and then I just going to end up passing them down to my daughter low she's seven we've got nft on like all the other different chains so I'd love to get some of the ICP nfts as well to pass down to her well thank you and welcome to the community and uh yeah we look forward to uh to seeing that wallet address maybe I'll send you some of mys as well awesome and I just want to give a big shout out to six figs and Renegade because they are big ICP people and they've really really pushed me in this

06:40:53	direction so big shout out to them thank you guys for having me [Music] all right we are back pcpcc it was great to see Isaac from Cen state in that video with Wendy O as I mentioned wendo is a massive presence in the crypto space she attends a lot of conferences and it's a pleasure to have her in the pcpcc hopefully we'll see wendyo at the Bitcoin Nashville conference coming up in July and if I'm not mistaken thein mentioned that there'd be a big event around Bitcoin Nashville so keep your eyes out for that and let's get a lot of

06:41:31	the ICP Community together to spread awareness about CK BTC at Bitcoin Nashville cuz that would be great now um again we're going to go into a Moko boot camp testimonial here from Thiago and then we're going to hear about decide AI so stay tuned hi everyone so my name is Thiago I've joined the Moto boot camp of 2023 it was an inperson event and really had a strong impact on on me because I chose to change my career from a web to the job for web three and choose the ecosystem of the IC um I've been working

06:42:10	on several projects one of them is related with Gold golf we have several reviewers on the team and uh we are also looking to expand into Dows and the code proposal s the other project is um an RPG game where you can play and uh as soon as you're getting an item it actually means this is a 2C finality it's actually mainting uh in real time and several other cool stuff and that's where I've been involved please join the voto C with [Music] [Music] Camp I'm the founder Ral of decide AI we're an AI platform on DIC hi I'm Jesse

06:43:07	and I'm a lead AI engineer at decide AI decide AI is an ecosystem supercharging llms currently AI is centralized to a few uh private large corporations and that raises ethical concerns privacy issues we believe that blockchain technology like the IC can be this counterbalancing Force to that centralized AI the IC has been giving us the ability to actually run AI on on chain we've released actually an AI model very recently which is an abusive language detector called redactor almost immediately give you a response for any

06:43:41	abusive language that you put into that prompt the whole process that the decide protocol has in place exhibits what was so successful in this new llama 3 released by meta which is the best open- source model and it's all about high quality data with lots of labeling so they had 50,000 uh examples like well annotated by humans and that was the key because they and that through various uh optimization processes but that data was what made it The annotation process itself will actually make the AI models

06:44:13	better than what you are seeing currently in the in the space so not only are we bringing things on chain but we're also going to pre- producing models that are better than what you see today A lot can go wrong if AI is not on chain people that control the AI can do whatever they want and you just have to accept the output like when Gemini was injecting prompts into every query it was controlling the response so that everything would always be PC to the point of not returning useful information and similarly Banks and

06:44:44	government agencies which use AI to decide who gets money or who gets organ donations behind closed doors provide benefits to those that they know or want to give money to rather than those that should so how decide AI is going to function it's more of like an umbrella company and we're going to be an ecosystem to build out you know uh AI models or or at least help in the AI model creation pipeline you know of our proof of humanity solution we're spitting that out into a separate product called decide ID that's going to

06:45:13	be upgraded to also include people to add like their credentials like University credentials or some kind of like skill set that they had and then also with using zero knowledge proofs other applications can access that if they want to to see oh yeah did this person Graduate University are they um qualified in say this skill set Etc decide ID will be used in our next product called decide protocol and so decide protocol is similar to what you've you've kind of witnessed with Mod Club um where you know kind of

06:45:40	moderators would come in and in in you know vote on data accept it reject it but instead now we're going to be focusing on um rhf which is reinforcement learning via human feedback what happened earlier with like the first G iterations of GPT gpt2 they weren't that great at responding basically were kind of like looked at as almost a flop only after open a in introduced rhf the responses became so much better the problem today with with rhf though is it's kind of done by big companies like scale AI we want to bring

06:46:08	that product offering you know to decentralized um space where anyone can access it uh it's really exciting because AI takes billions of transactions even for just a single word it requires unique consensus algorithm that only the IC provides that's the only way we can process AI on chain if you're interested to uh learn more about AI on chain we'd love for you to come to our website check it out decide axyz we're looking for data annotator so you can sign up on at decide ID and then also if you're a um you know a platform

06:46:43	that's looking for fine-tuning an AI model check out Desi protocol and we can you know help you know train a model to align to your use case so check us out at desde axyz um and we're looking forward to hearing from you [Music] [Music] all right welcome back pcpcc we had a great video there from decide Ai and uh airdrop if you caught that one make sure you're punching in the code all airdrops will be distributed within the next 48 hours after the pcpcc has concluded now I do want to go in we're about 6 hours

06:47:40	and 50 minutes in here uh I'm definitely about to hit a second wind I'm definitely feeling it we got a couple hours left with a panel to come shortly uh but let's get into a new video from maow so hi everyone my name is Adam Miller and I'm the CEO and co-founder of maow which stands for Marshall Islands Dao maid da is the company that's created the best legal entity in the world made for web 3 and Dows so dowo stands for decentralized autonomous organization but that really makes it sound a little more complicated

06:48:19	than it is to me a DA is any organization that uses the blockchain for one or more of these three things tracking its membership doing its governance I.E usually voting and managing its treasury or sometimes a protocol by doing these things on chain not only are you getting access to transparency guaranteed compliance but it allows you to start an organization as easily as you can start a website or launch a website and scale an organization as fast as you can scale a website on the cloud and so for the

06:48:49	first time in human history we have a way of organizing ourselves and our Resources with so much less friction that you can do things in one week that previously were not even possible to do in 6 months the reason daas are going to change the world is organizing ourselves is one of the key elements of humanity if you look at what researchers and academics talk about as what makes humans different from other species it's not that we're necessarily faster and stronger or even smarter or we maybe we're one of the

06:49:21	smartest it's the way we socialize and collaborate and organize and so when you introduce a new technology or a new approach to organizing people that has the ability to completely transform life on earth now introduce things like Ai and autonomous agents the fact that with Dows you could effectively have members that are computers that just takes it to another level but even without that enabling a new form of human organization that's so much more transparent and compliant can scale much more globally that is extremely

06:49:55	powerful we started my da let me go back to the beginning about 3 years ago I was personally working for a DA building software and the Dow was offered a million-- dooll grant from the Moonbeam ecosystem fund and that fund said to accept this million-dollar Grant you have to sign this grant agreement which means you need a legal entity for your doubt and so we looked around the world we looked at common options like Delaware Switzerland Cayman Islands and came to the realization that literally every single legal entity in the world

06:50:24	requires you to do certain things that we don't believe any da or most Dows are going to want to do so that includes things like requiring Dows to have some kind of management team a board directors officers trustees managers whatever a lot of dows don't want to have managers at least in the long run additionally every legal entity in the world until recently required companies to know the names and physical addresses of all of their members and we again felt like our da and no other da at least many Dows want to be able to have

06:50:53	Anonymous members and so because of these two issues we reached out to a senator in the Marshall Islands now the Marshall Islands is a former US Territory but a Sovereign Nation in the South Pacific that has long been one of the most popular jurisdictions in the shipping industry so there are something like 40 or 50 publicly traded companies on the New York Stock Exchange that are Marshall Islands companies so we reached out to the Marshall Islands Senator and said hey in some ways Dows are kind of

06:51:17	like ships they don't live in any one place they're kind of everywhere and nowhere at the same time so how would you like to expand your country's expertise from Shipping into web 3 and Dows that's led to the writing and passing of three laws in the Marshall Islands that have created a nonprofit and for profit Dow LLC a legal entity that's made for web 3 and Dows and we started the company maow which again stands for Marshall Islands Dow it's a partnership between the government of the Marshall Islands and our private

06:51:45	company and this partnership is the registered agent that can create and maintain these Dow llc's for people our job is to promote this around the world and then when someone whether it's an ICP ecosystem or otherwise decides they want to create a legal entity for their Dow or web 3 project they can reach out to us and we can help facilitate with template documents Etc to get them registered in the Marshall Islands so a lot of people ask me what is the risk of having an unregistered doubt so what if you don't form a legal

06:52:18	entity anywhere and actually that's become extremely clear over the past several months as Dows that are unregistered have ended up in court cases in the United States at least where the judge has said specifically and this is what lawyers would have told you for the last 10 years any group of people that's engaged in a common Enterprise and so that includes Dows that is not registered with the government as some kind of legal entity gets a default treatment according to the law and that default treatment is

06:52:43	called a general partnership what happens with a general partnership is that every single member of the Dow can be held liable for the entire Dow's activity if anything goes wrong with your Dao every single person involved in the Dao can have their home taken away their car taken away I mean literally you can be completely held liable for the entire doubt now beyond that there's also a tax liability so let's say that Dao has 100 members each with 1% of the ownership or voting rights in the dowo

06:53:09	and no legal entity from the irs's perspective and also from the perspective of tax uh institutions around the world if that Dow makes money in a given year each person is responsible for paying taxes on 1% of that Dow's earnings irrespective of whether that person saw any of that money so you've got the legal liability you've got the tax liability and going back to the reason I mentioned we started maow in the first place St without a legal entity cannot enter into agreements with other organizations or

06:53:37	people and that means you can't hire an employee you can't enter into a contract to rent a space at an event you can't rent an Airbnb can't open a bank account there's all these things you cannot do unless you have a legal entity beyond the legal and tax liability inherent in operating a dow without a legal entity so you might wonder how the Marshall Island Dow LLC compares to other uh options from around the world so there's the two key benefits I mentioned earlier right that with the Dow LLC you don't have to have any kind

06:54:08	of management team so you can be truly decentralized and you can have fully Anonymous membership so people can be members simply by holding your governance or membership token but the benefits do go beyond that so for example the cost is much lower than places like the Cayman Islands and the reason for that is that in the Cayman Islands anyone is required to hire on an ongoing basis a local law firm and an independent director a person that you pay to sit on your board which again I think it's crazy that Dows even would

06:54:35	want to have a board in the first place but a lot of dows do believe it or not and so you end up with these massive initial and ongoing expenses and my da doesn't have those two requirements there's also clear Securities treatment so in the Dow act in the Marshall Islands it very specifically says situations where a governance token is not a security and so that can help you for example let's say you want to get your token listed on a centralized exchange one of the first questions they will ask you is is your token a security

06:55:02	in the local jurisdiction where your da is registered Additionally you have a better recordkeeping requirements so in a lot of jurisdictions you have to do all these annual documentation resolutions all this stuff in the Marshall Islands the law the Dow act says as long as you are keeping all of your records on the blockchain and that they can be converted into human readable format you don't have to keep your records anywhere else the list goes on you know what we've done is we've really collected input over the past few

06:55:25	years from lawyers all over the world that that work in this business and said hey what would you like to see in an ideal law for web 3 and Dows and then we've worked to include those laws in a way that also conforms to International standards so that we and the Dows don't get in trouble you know by doing this one of the things I'm really excited to talk about is maida is the legal entity the pcpcc da is actually using and we're also already working with other SNS Dows in the ICP ecosystem my da and and it's the Dow LLC we've

06:56:00	created allows a DA to be truly decentralized and obviously ICP is a very modern blockchain it's maybe more advanced than many of the others that are out there it allows organizations to be truly decentralized to operate without a board without a management team we're excited to be part of an ecosystem where people truly want to be decentralized they really want the Dow to be in control onchain and offchain so if you're going to join a dow and you want to make sure that it is properly registered and I'd say not just

06:56:31	properly registered but it has considered the legal and Regulatory implications of its work you should just ask the question look for documentation is there some kind of founding document whether it's registered or not is there a constitution is there an operating agreement in the case of a dow LLC are there certified documents that are stamped by a government just by asking those questions you can make sure that the Dow that you're joining that the people there maybe the leaders there if they are leaders are paying attention to

06:56:56	these issues and if you join a doubt where no one's even realized that it's important to look at regulatory risk maybe you're the one that can bring that to the table for them so if anyone is interested in getting started with maow or learning more I want to also announce that we're offering uh two things one is a 10% discount to anyone in the ICP ecosystem on our registration fee and two is actually a 10% referral reward to the pcpcc Dow for helping get us connected with the ecosystem and so if you're

06:57:29	interested in learning more you can either reach out to pcpcc and they can make a referral or reach out to us directly you can find me on foraster if you're into forecaster at the Thriller Twitter I'm zerox thriller or you can just find myow at my.org and just mention ICP when you're filling out the form or when you reach out to us to make sure that you get that uh discount really excited to be part of the ecosystem I should mention I do have a podcast of my own called just Dow it the podcast for people starting Dows you can

06:57:56	find it on any major podcast platform I always interview dowo Founders we'll be talking to IC PCC on the show shortly as well we ask some questions about what it's like starting a dow leading a dow what are the challenges you run into what are your favorite tools favorite Dows to check out if you're into Dows it's a great show to check out and again especially if you're on farcaster I encourage you to track me down at the Thriller uh Reach Out say you saw this talk and I'd love to connect with you

06:58:21	there [Music] [Music] all right ICP we are back and just want to say coming up in a little bit we're going to have our guest Cod and state which will be Isaac and Cedric and then in a little bit after that we're going to have our panels here in Milwaukee so we'll have three separate panels and then coming up even after that we'll be cracking FTX which is a documentary by six figs but first we're going to get into dma's Journey on ICP dmail is an AI powered uh web3 communications platform we started out

06:59:22	in 2021 quite literally being with ICP from the start I actually started out as an angel investor in dmail I got to know the the dmail team learned that they won the 2021 wanang hackathon a big hackathon in China the more I talked with the team the more I understood that aiming to solve uh communication pain points in web 3 plus the fact that you know there was an emerging research report which projected that by 2028 encrypted email Market would be worth $19 billion and if you actually look there's not that much competition in

06:59:55	that area they offered me a role to come on board as coo and here I am you know when I started out the dill we had a few hundred, ,000 users we've grown to 9 million registered users we are integrated on 20 chains so we're a flagship multi-chain project I think for ICP at this point we have staggering transaction volume more than 160 million messages we're listed on top exchanges uh including you know exchanges like bit okx I think what really excites me is the next 18 months moving forward the

07:00:25	tokenization of the platform the empowerment of users these are all things that really excite me and I know that we're going to go from the 9 million users that we have I think it's easy to do a 10x we're going to have 100 million users within two years the fact is is that ICP has the largest R&D operation in in crypto more than 200 Top engineers and top brains in the industry you know working on this highly Innovative chain if you think about just a simple question how can you make web3 messaging and emailing work

07:01:00	well first of all it will be helpful if the user doesn't have to pay gas fees right ICP makes that possible some chains are touting that they can be gas free and so on ICP did this in 20201 it was well ahead of the curve the reverse gas model enables users to to send messages gas free we've always been well supported by um the different de Foundation we've received multiple uh grants recently went to a event uh East Denver had a great interview with Kyle langum there we discussed how dmail has essentially become the def acto web 3

07:01:33	poster boy if you like for for multi-chain projects in the space and we do serve as a template for for projects moving forward you can deploy on ICP you can utilize the Innovative Tech and then you can Branch out and you know you can grow to millions of users in States so I think we've done that very very well in terms of our road map I actually use dmail and Gmail at this point you know and I'm the COO at at dmail and I have to be honest that I still use Gmail and so why is that why is it that I

07:02:07	still want to use Gmail even though we are building this fantastic web 3 product and the fact is is that on Gmail you have Google Calendars you have the Google Drive you have all of these different things and so meanwhile I'm still using Gmail for for those things but what I'm really excited about is that we are replicating all of this workplace functionality within the next quarter actually we're we're we're aiming to build out the calendar the decentralized Drive essentially everything that you have in your web to

07:02:36	email except of course we don't Farm your data you're not the product on uh dmail and we of course will have the web three layer on top the thing that I'm really excited about something called mail to earn when you engage with certain aspects on the platform you can engage with our subscription Hub our marketing Hub uh for example and you can subscribe to projects and you can open mail so let's say that you want to open mail in web three and for every time you open the mail the project gives you one

07:03:06	token a token could be a fraction of a penny who knows within that email within that message that they send on the subscription Hub is an embedded campaign it's like there's gold hidden in each message and So within the campaign you can then basically go through it like a Galaxy campaign and you can go through all of the call to actions and then there could be a much bigger reward than that one token it could be 100 tokens right for completing all the tasks you're going to see Skyhigh opening rates

07:03:32	you're going to see Sky High subscription rates because everybody wants a piece of the pie everybody wants to get paid it's going to be incredibly exciting to see where we are and and how people are using this and how people are enjoying a platform what you're going to see with the token is multiple use cases first of all there will be an nft Marketplace so I said that I've got Daniel at email. a Daniel is going to be quite a prized one because it's it's quite a common name I could probably sell it in the

07:04:02	marketplace in the future for a decent amount of money uh but I'm not going to sell it I'll be keeping that one we'll also be using dmail for Dow governance in the future that's a little bit further down the line I think the community and and and probably me as well I'm most excited about is staking and I can confirm that staking will be available uh in the pretty near future actually that's a bit of alpha today that I'm giving out but uh I can confirm that certainly we will have staking of Dil and that will be very positive for

07:04:33	for the token itself where you'll be able to have extra storage or premium features like uh uh we have um AI assistant and so you'll be able to upgrade your AI assistant with uh with dmail in the future as well and there will be multiple features premium features within the platform as well [Music] [Music] Helix markets is a next Genex it's using all of the cool features of the IC so we offer cross chain trading so if you're coming from another ecosystem you don't have to figure out all the wallets we do

07:05:25	this for you all the gas handling is taken care of we're all about making trading accessible and easy for everyone you can do this on our desktop version or you can use our mobile app with Helix you get best of both RS you get the Speed and Performance of a centralized exchange with the non-custodial part of a decentralized exchange where you always in control of your assets and we're also regulated which means that there was always a person to call if something goes wrong so if you want to check out how easy trading can be go to

07:05:52	Helix markets register and trade your favorite coins what's up Brothers we're back we got special teams special players Isaac and Cedric are going to be coming up from Coden state but first I do want to give you all a reminder that you should be giving a standing ovation to everyone that's put this together Isaac Cedric estabon who's here with us make sure you're getting up give him a round of applause if you have a Gatorade jug dump it on him I know Isaac's been you know Isaac and esan been you know trying to

07:06:28	make this day as perfect as possible and you know we've all come together we got a great group of people with us and I'm sure as as many other locations have the same so make sure you're giving them your undivided attention as we now present you Cod and state with Isaac and Cedric hey my name is Cedric and I'm wearing a bunch of different hats in the ICP ecosystem for one I've been part of the team that helped build the definity foundation I'm a no provider meaning I run run some of the service that power

07:07:03	the definity or ICP Network I have a venture fund where I've invested in a number of companies that are building in ICP ecosystem and last but definitely not least I am one of the founders of cod and state the organization that's also behind ICPC and in the next few minutes I want to tell you a bit about why I care so much about the IC ecosystem and then also what Coden state is and whether or not you should maybe uh come join us at Coden state so to take things back a bit about years ago in 2011 is when one of my colleagues at

07:07:35	a web 2 startup borrowed my laptop over launch to mine some Bitcoin and that got me really curious it led me to sit down on the weekend and start researching Bitcoin and I went down the entire rabbit hole and found this technology just fascinating the fact that we could now have a scars digital asset especially in a decentralized and trustless environment just blew my mind back then and I've never left the decentralized world ever since for the first couple years I just got excited about Bitcoin and I looked looked into

07:08:02	different use cases back then very limited compared to today and a lot of it was illicit but it still sparked my curiosity and I kept following the developments in the decentralized world then of course 2014 ethereum was released and my mind was blown again I thought it was fascinating the fact that we could now not just only share tokens in a decentralized manner but we could also add some logic and write these decentralized contracts with one another fast forward a couple years and I meet Dom and he pictures me the idea for

07:08:30	definity and I was immediately taken by not only P determination to make this a reality it sounded very complex at the time but also very excited about how this was not just another variation of ethereum or Bitcoin but something that was truly new and complimentary to what's already out there before we dive deeper into the ICP ecosystem and what we're doing with code and state along the way of spending time with decentralized Technologies of course I sat down many times and I thought about like what is it that's going to happen

07:08:59	with this why do I care so much about decentralization and the answer that I find for myself is I think the qualities that we get from decentralized technology are so powerful and so positive that we want to apply them to not just this very limited use case of decentralized Finance or sending tokens from one person to the other but that we want to try and scale them across all Industries and all use cases in our lives so what I mean is decentralized technology enables us to have a trustless environment it enables

07:09:28	immutability it enables transparency on a different level I could go on and on about these qualities but what's very clear to me is that we not only want to apply these to finance we want to find ways to make our governance system more transparent we want to find ways to make records in our Educational Systems more immutable and we want to find ways to make interaction with let's say our healthc care system more trustless and that's really what's put me on this journey for the past almost 15 years now

07:09:57	where I've tried to innovate and find ways to bring these centralized technology and their qualities into our daily lives so I've already mentioned that I'm wearing a bunch of different hats in the ICP ecosystem and I'm very passionate about all of those but then the most important role I took on about two years ago artia who used to be coo at the definity foundation and I met again in I think it was in LA we sat down at a cafe and we talked about the state of the ecosystem and we were both in agreement that the internet computer

07:10:26	is this incredibly powerful and smart machine and at the same time our ecosystem had taken off the same way we saw with other seemingly much less complex pieces of Technology we sat down and we started talking about a what's causing this what's the root of this and second more importantly because we're both entrepreneurs what can we do to change this and the answer for us seemed pretty clear like if we can create a company a structure a place that entrepreneurs can come to and they can solve these problems then Not only would

07:10:56	we not have to solve this by ourselves with our limited resources or we could hopefully scale ourselves 100x now we're not the first people to come up with this idea and to uh invent this model but it's been done both in web 2 and web 3 in web 3 the most prominent player that uses a similar model as code and state is probably consensus it's the organization in the ethereum ecosystem started by one of the co-founders of ethereum Joe Luben that has incorporated not just metamask and inura but hundreds

07:11:25	of different apps in the ecosystem and probably spurred a lot of the activity that we've seen in the last 10 years the vision for C state is incredibly simple we want to make it easier to build and earn in the ICP ecosystem why do we want to make it easier to build well because we think if it's easier to build then not only five 10 dozens or hundreds of teams are going to build in the ICP ecosystem but at some point thousands of teams and if it's so easy to build and test an application within a weekend

07:11:53	within a summer break then it becomes much much more likely that we're going to find killer applications that leverage ethereum Bitcoin but also ICP and apply it in various areas like healthcare or governance systems and we'll see the world improve because people use this novel technology to bring it to real life use cases second why do we think it's very important that we make it easier to earn on the IC well because not everything is a weekend project right so while it's great if you can sit down and give an idea of first

07:12:23	try on a weekend or during a summer break at some point for you to sustain your livelihood and build a team and create something truly powerful there needs to be a very clear mechanism for how you can earn a salary and your livelihood within the ecosystem so those are the two key components make it easier to build and make it easier to earn on the ICP ecosystem our mission is to create an accelerator and incubator what does that mean well accelerator meaning if you already are working on an idea that helps these two causes making

07:12:54	it easier to build or earn you should be able to come to code and state and get value and resources from us that allow you to accelerate at on your journey to go quicker to where you want to go and incubator means even if you don't clearly have the idea yet Coden State should be the place that you come to and you find an environment that is so nurturing that you find your idea you find your teammates you maybe even find your first customers and you sit down and you start building the way we do this both on the accelerator and the

07:13:23	incubator side is by helping you with lots of resources that are not monetary yes money is hard to come by but there's also lots of other resources that even harder to come by especially in the web 3 world where a lot of the questions just aren't answered yet how should you set up your company how do you do marketing for web 3 how do you hire your team members that may be sitting in five different jurisdictions how do you design good tokenomics how much of your token Supply should go to the team

07:13:49	versus your investors and so on there's lots of questions and at Coden State we've assembled a very dedicated agile team that help you with all those areas so you as an entrepreneur can fully focus on your idea and accelerating that one towards a public launch and bringing it into the world how does cod and state profit from this and how do we Finance ourselves well the idea behind con state is to be a great alternative to preed funding normally if you are building a venture it means you go out you look for

07:14:17	investors you raise your preed round and you give up some shares the idea with Cod state is extremely similar so in return for receiving money to finance your operations for the first 12 to 24 months as well as for getting insight into all these different topics and getting access to the entire Cod and State team and Beyond we also take a cut in your venture or your token once you launch later on so so far what are some of the ventures that have either gone through the acceleration or incubation

07:14:44	process with Coden State 18 months ago it was very hard to build on the IC even if you figured out how to build on the IC it was hard to get a job even if you got a job and were building something it was hard to get a clear sense of how secure it is what you've built and last but not least there was not really a good place to share what you've build and connect with others so we've worked on all these challenges and we've built Moko boot camp which is a onewe course um and now also a self-study course

07:15:11	where you can go from knowing nothing about the IC to not only knowing how to build on the IC but also deploying your first Dow live on the IC within just one week second we've created Talent DB Talent DB is a place where either you as a venture goto and you can scale your operations by hiring great talent that is assessed and has gone through a rigorous interview flow but it's also the place for you as a builder to go and say hey I am ready to jump into this fulltime I am looking for a role and Ben

07:15:41	who leads Talent TB does a great job matching those two sides together once you are building at a startup or at a venture and you're getting ready to share your product with the world you want to make sure that what you are about to release is safe because very often Buck can not only just mean downtime or someone has a slightly worse user experience than what they're used to but it can mean actual Financial loss and so it's extremely important that you have experts you can rely on to review your code and point out any potential

07:16:10	vulnerabilities before you go live we've created solid state which does exactly that it connects you with Auditors and it puts your code and product through a rigorous testing and Analysis process to make sure it's safe and secure before it's being released and you can sleep well knowing that what you're putting out into the world doesn't have any box in it and last but not least the event you're watching right now pcpcc we created an inperson event last year to give a big stage to those that have been

07:16:40	building in the ecosystem for a long time but potentially have never met their counterparties in the real world and this year we are focusing the event on sharing everything that we've learned about the IC with not just the ICP ecosystem but anyone in web 3 so hopefully you're making some really good friends this weekend hopefully you're learning about the IC I'm sure you will come up with lots of questions feel free to talk to any of us at Coden state if you're just curious about ICP or the internet computer but also if you have

07:17:09	an idea for how to make it easier to build or earn I can't wait to speak to you have a beautiful day and we'll talk soon [Music] hello guys we're back it's Daniel from the swap here I have a uh a special group of gentlemen with me today as Rob and Alex um and we're going to be talking a little bit about blockchain and AI convergence so uh guys tell me a little bit about yourselves and what you do yeah um Alex uh and thank you for having me on Dan I do appreciate that um I'm actually here locally here in

07:17:59	Milwaukee um a few blocks away from the studio here um but uh about a year and a half ago two years ago I got into the industry from uh a project that I've been working on I found out about ICP and it just made sense for me to diverge into the space uh I've got a lot of excitement going on though with it it's it's very uh well diversed and it's it's non-stop growing so I've gotten into the the AI has has more excitement but I do like the blockchain side of things very very much hey uh Robert Rosco I've been in

07:18:30	the uh Texas space for a little over a decade largely in the data engineering space probably about 6 or seven years now uh I really got into blockchain pretty much right when it was uh starting to come out with Bitcoin because uh obviously the first immutable database is a pretty revolutionary technology you got to keep track of when it comes to uh data and inte data Integrity uh I've also been working in the AI space for probably uh three or four years now building out AI based applications you know going back to

07:18:56	machine learning days when it was still that term before it got you know all high powerered in its AI now so yeah that's a little bit about me I'm also a Milwaukee native so I'm really here and I'm really excited to you know to talk about ICP yeah hey it's great to have you guys uh thank you both for coming also I I uh I traveled in from New York so obviously I'm I'm not Milwaukee native but yeah it's great to hear um all these people from Milwaukee and all the people that are here at our event

07:19:20	today are doing uh doing things out here for blockchain and AI um so how do you guys feel that uh that blockchain and AI work well together what do you guys think the the pros and cons are of that um honestly I think it's going to be a massive Powerhouse um you've got artificial intelligence that is non-stop growing developing just like any other industry though obviously there's pros and cons I think that the pros are definitely going to outweigh the cons there's a few minor you know threat levels and stuff like that but for the

07:19:48	majority of it I think the pros definitely outweigh them there's so the industry is so much larger in a pro concept um than the threat side of thing so I'm just really excited for that um also with the blockchain side it's the security of it and so when you're putting something so secure with something that um can develop so easy and be so efficient actually I think it's actually going to make sure that uh people are able to focus on either their livelihood or anything so they don't have to worry about the minute details

07:20:16	of their job or industry and they can actually have ai be the assistance to their job and it just makes them more efficient it also makes uh anything that they're in their industry more efficient so um the the two together is just going to be insane it's kind of like um when I found found out about like iccp I just fell in love with it um from uh Dominic Williams when he built it it's incredible how long he took to develop it and then before he released it he put so much minute detail into it so that

07:20:43	you can eliminate that for individuals in the career space um and that's I'm yeah I'm just more excited about them being together you got a security and a sense of efficiency more people can just focus on their livelihood of it and I always look at it uh an easy comparison I guess as like how when the engine was built just for in general terms the car came from it tractors uh any efficiency of lines uh product lines anything like that and now I feel like that's where ICP is is it's the initial start of

07:21:13	something and now it can just take off in so many different Avenues and ways that that's what everyone else is here to do and once you learn about ICP you're able to just go any idea that you really have it's going to be there for a security and more of efficiency protocol yeah I that's that's a wonderful answer actually I would say yeah very similar stuff for sure yeah I think Ai and blockchain has a great convergence uh largely because we are dealing with massive models that take tons of data and I think utilizing

07:21:40	blockchain to track some of the data we're or we're using to train is going to be absolutely critical I mean that's the big differentiator in a lot of different AI tools is the different data they can be trained on and we're already running into the issue of uh what data were they trained on we're seeing copyright lawsuits and and different problems regarding that so I think having the ability to ensure that the data you're training on and tracking it with blockchain is going to be absolutely critical uh for any form of

07:22:04	compliance uh any you know legal problems people are going to get into in deploying blockchain I also think when it comes to the use of AI when you're actually generating those responses or data sets or images or videos I think utilizing blockchain technology to track what its output is is going to be extraordinarily valuable we're seeing some threat actors as he mentioned the negatives of it uh and so the ability to have entire traceability of all the outputs from AI is going to be absolutely critical with blockchain um I

07:22:32	think it's there's no more trustable data source and when we're dealing with you know data tools that are this size when it comes to AI uh I I like said I just think blockchain is going to be absolutely critical for that convergence of those two products that's yeah I again same yeah that's about what I would what I would say for it as well um actually adding on to that the uh I do like the storage space that it can handle and also when you whenever you have to do uh data statistics anything like that in any

07:22:59	industry that I think is might be overlooked a little bit is just in the like sporting industry or anything like that you can go back in to when it can just generate data that humans don't have the time to whereas just by putting in those inputs that you're trying to figure out uh stats numbers anything like that you can get quick results and then by using blockchain you can't and and almost close to immutable you um it can't be tampered with once the statistic and numbers are there just in any industry I like to focus on Sports

07:23:28	but once you get that data all it is is just just you just Compound on that year after year and it's just statistically uh immutable at that point basically uh I mean yeah it's going to be it's going to be a huge convergence and I think uh me personally ICP I think um benefits that in a lot of ways or can as you were mentioning earlier you had said uh some you had made some remarks on that as well uh Rob I'd like to hear a little bit more from you as well about how you how you believe ICP can help that blockchain and

07:23:58	AI convergence well I think ICP has a huge tactical advantage in terms of the data volumes they can handle I mean I think we're all pretty familiar that uh BTC and ethereum can't handle the kind of data volumes that ICP can and so uh when it comes to storing data what I like to say when it comes to a lot of media is Hash is trash uh and it's h like don't get me wrong uh hashing is great for ensuring that an application's never been altered but when it comes to any form of pictures audio video uh

07:24:26	anytime you're slicing cutting editing trimming cropping changing the Hue or speed of video that's a new hash and so a lot of the ways that they're us uh using blockchain right now is just using hash values for the media and that's not going to work long term because media at least in the form that we use it for nowadays you know Tik toks your YouTube videos uh we're splicing and editing things constantly so we're going to need a place that we can hold a significant amount of data and do it at a very low

07:24:55	cost because one of the other problems we're going to run into is gas prices uh so if you're you know doing tons of transactions is going to be extraordinarily expensive and ICP has the huge advantage of being extraordinarily energy efficient without being really negative to like the environment uh the energy cost to operate I think we're going to have a great opportunity to have a deeper and more robust level of traceability with ICP uh and it's the distribution model for it is fantastic I mean you're not

07:25:23	going to get something more secure than you know you know servers across the globe so I think it's it's a fantastic infrastructure really poised to be a huge Advantage for integrating Ai and blockchain yeah it's an amazing answer honestly yeah that sounds yeah ICP is it's been really uh it's been really breaking ground the last last couple years especially as it moves toward AI convergence with itself and also the interoperability formats that it's taking on and it's it's definitely as you mentioned it's taking on a lot of

07:25:53	like a lot of different roots that it it could it could kind of succeed in so is there any other uh any other thoughts you might have on that I mean the uh just like as he was saying or as Rob was saying earlier the competitors they just can't they don't have the bandwidth or the transaction speeds of ICP and it's quite astonishing actually just to have a platform that is able to I mean run five times a speed without and just not having any like crashes or anything like that it it's phenomenal to see something

07:26:21	like that and like anyone else who wants to um I mean if you're a sports guy or anything um you always want to be with the guy who's doing the best or is the most Innovative or is leading imagine something and I do think that ICP is they are the PowerHouse in this industry of blockchain network yeah I I I agree uh Rob do you have any uh any any thoughts any final thoughts yeah I think uh their ability for ICP to host applications the way it can is absolutely fantastic and I think it's going to open the doors to a lot higher

07:26:50	level of security that I don't think other blockchains are going to be able to do yeah very very amazing yeah and uh yeah I would say uh thank you both for your time it's been a pleasure to hear from both of you uh that was fantastic thank you so much for the thoughts we would love to also connect yeah thank you very much Dan for having me appreciate it y too many jargons Cloud up the wet through space retrieval augmented generation reverse gas fee GPU making it difficult for a regular person to

07:27:24	clearly understand what's going on so allow us to explain what el. a is in the simplest way possible Ela is decentralizing AI using blockchain in the wet three space meaning we are making ai's governance transparent and your data secure and private now why are we doing this currently AI is centralized and controlled by corporates like Google Microsoft AWS Etc and they have a non-transparent hold on your data and privacy so how are we changing this Elna is breaking the cycle of centralization by being a platform that creates

07:28:16	generative AI agents that run on blockchain giving the power back to the users and by helping you create agents that you can monetize to gain income come from now what exactly are these AI agents they can be a personal finance manager a social media manager personal tutor tele medicine screening agent for doctors Legal Assistant for lawyers data analyst with realtime Intel the possibilities of a flying Ela to create specialized generative AI agents are truly Limitless let's address a question we

07:29:10	commonly get though is Ela a chatbot the answer is not really you can make a chat bot using Ela but it's only the tip of the iceberg think of ela as a workshop with all the laads tools and machinery along with a highly skilled Workforce say you want to create a mini airplane all by yourself sourcing the propeller fuselage Wings engine control board making the machine and running it all by yourself too much effort isn't it the same way it's difficult to put together a fully functional AI agent all by

07:29:59	oneself instead just tell Elna the features of the plane you want Ela is powered by llm configuration fine-tuning and integration tools prompt engine to design and instruct the agent's Behavior Vector DB for external memory and knowledge base and integration tools to connect with external platforms like X Instagram Etc we at Ela are doing all the heavy lifting so that you can create your AI companion in three simple steps welcome to the future of generative AI on [Music] blockchain all right and we are now back

07:31:00	back pcpcc uh we did just see a video from Elena AI after our excellent AI panel as Daniel moderated with Robin Alex so thank you Robin Alex for being on that panel with us and right now we have Jesse Williams and Daniel McCoy and uh I'm going to give you guys a moment to tell everyone what it is you're building right um uh you'll have to excuse me my voice is a little I lost my voice yesterday but um so uh my name is Jesse D Williams Jr I am the uh founder and developer behind the personal da protocol which is a um a turnkey

07:31:45	decentralized autonomous organization that um communities can use to uh to uh kickart a lending institution that is owned operated governed and controlled exclusively by that Community um and um uh I forgot the other queue um but I'll let you go yeah um so obviously my name is Daniel McCoy a lot of you guys know me uh CT all the swap I've been in the IC for about three years or say since Genesis I've worked on a lot of different projects including uh like autonomous canister launching creation um I've done a lot of UN database work I

07:32:31	work heavily with ail and rust um and I am currently working on a decentralized Google Drive and also some of the applications behind uh the swaps media all right and you know as as we know Daniel mentioned he's been building a lot of stuff and and Jesse here has been building a lot of great stuff as well with personal doubt uh what are some of the benefits and challenges that you've experienced with building on ICP um a benefit a really big benefit so uh the thing that I'm creating um it only works if uh

07:33:07	the entire application can be bundled into smart contracts and then uh transferred to the communities that depend on them it doesn't work if uh a portion of it is built on AWS or Azure um and only the financial settlement layer is built on uh chain in that scenario it wouldn't work so um what is unique to the ICP a benefit that is unique to the ICP uh blockchain is that it is the only blockchain that I know of um where you as a developer can place an entire digital commodity uh digital product application inside a smart contract

07:33:58	canisters bundle that up and transfer those canister smart contracts from yourself the developer to your users so that's a benefit um I would say a con is just that it's such a new architecture and Technology uh that there aren't that many libraries uh built and that much tooling that's available uh to use on it but that con um you know with time and advancements uh that con becomes less and less of an issue on the internet computer and and Daniel what are some benefits and challenges that you've experienced with

07:34:38	building on ICP oh yeah that's a that's a very good question um yeah so uh I mean it it was definitely much worse uh when we all first started back in 2021 at Genesis I believe that a lot of tooling wasn't available things did not work a lot of things were Alpha we we really went through the ringer with a lot of things and if you needed to build something complex you needed to build it all yourself um uh definity was was really good with working hand inand with teams like that but as time progressed you

07:35:10	know we're about three years in now or we are three years in and uh a lot of things have come a really far away um a lot of things uh that we were struggling with before that I would have considered to be challenges were again uh the just the immaturity of the tooling which from uh even uh people like ourselves uh Jesse and I have have contributed tooling uh to the ecosystem but also shout out to people like uh uh the tonic and bionic team um Jordan last especially with ail and kibra um and developments from definity with other

07:35:43	web packaging that has made development on the IC so much easier um over the period of three years uh that now we're starting to build complex industry ready applications um a lot quicker and a lot easier and also the um I would say another uh Pro of working on the IC is really about the community so the community of developers and Founders is we're all out to help each other so when you got developers that are trying to build something uh and they're having trouble there are other developers that have

07:36:13	likely run into that trouble and we're all willing to give each other a helping hand um so basically working together um in the way that web 3 should work we've really made ICP a Powerhouse platform by allowing other developers to use the same tooling that we spent years building for each other um so it's kind of like a team it's a team effort as far as current challenges go uh that's interesting because uh the current challenges are really because we're coming out with new features all the time on definity side with uh with chain

07:36:46	key or chain fusion um with uh working on the AI stuff uh boting up their their uh just strengthening their asset layer and coming out with all these new features and tools these new token standards that are um much more intuitive it uh it does it does bring about a hefty challenge for us developers uh but since we've been doing that and we're used to the iter of design concept A lot of us we we just adapt to it as best as we can and then do our best to make use of that information to help new people coming in

07:37:16	the ecosystem looking to build yeah awesome I love to hear it and you know as a builder myself in ICP I definitely relate Daniel you know we have the same issues so uh one of the things that i' like to mention like because we've done a lot of air drops with the swap of course uh I would say my biggest frustration is airdropping too many wallets individually but um you know we have one that we're doing with tonic bionic uh Marketplace um and it was like 100,000 wallets that we are dropping so we hit a little bit of friction points

07:37:49	but you know uh but that's coming soon and you know it's one of the one of the perks of being early on a network you get to help build and provide products but uh yeah I think you know you both touch on some very valuable points um you know with being here for the pcpcc do you have any messages that you'd like to get out for the community or any other additional comments that you might want to touch on before we wrap up uh yes so the personal Dow um OG Dow members access pass is currently available on tonic Marketplace um

07:38:24	they're selling really quick so and once they're gone they're gone we won't be creating any new new one so um get them while supplies last yeah I'm definitely going to have to check into that cuz I've I've been a big fan of personal doubt for a long time um yeah I guess for us uh just watch out for the swaps new website the swap. XYZ uh will be launching hopefully this week with a bunch of new tabs and features and then also keep an eye out for a Q3 release update for um an app that I've been working on for about two

07:38:57	years uh that I have uh I can't really say too much on right now but we have a nice uh nice branding product coming out soon and uh we're hoping to uh really really shake up the industry with it so um stay tuned for that you can find me at real Dan McCoy on Twitter or X um and that is the best place to keep up with my updates awesome love to hear it guys and uh yeah we're going to cut to a brief ad here momentarily but we'll have a new panel up shortly so [Music] n [Music] [Music] all right and we're back uh here today

07:40:29	we have uh actually two of our own uh from the swap we have Kyle and Adam um who are here today to talk about web three events and the importance of them in the industry so first let me just uh have you guys give a short introduction tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got into the web 3 in blockchain space so yeah my name is Adam McCoy and obviously I'm your brother and you're actually the one that got me into web 3 I'm the community relations manager for the Swap and have been with Kyle for

07:40:58	about a year now and I started out as a community Builder worked in the music industry and somehow eventually found myself over to web 3 and blockchain awesome and yeah of course I've had the pleasure of working with both these lovely McCoys The Real McCoy might I add um and yeah so like my first journey into blockchain was actually back in 2011 uh my friend Joey uh was like hey there's this currency called Bitcoin you know we got to mine it and uh so turns in like a couple couple months later my buddy Mason and Joey

07:41:32	were all basement you know gaming and all this and we're just like mining Bitcoin a little bit at a time lost that forgot about crypto for a few years checked back back in like 2017 18 saw the price of Bitcoin I'm like wow like I just need to take this seriously now that you know we lost all that all of the stuff that we minded um but yeah I've had the pleasure of working with both the two McCoy here and yeah looking forward to the next question so yeah so uh the next one I got up for you guys is

07:42:00	uh how do you guys so like obviously you've both uh we've all actually attended a lot of web 3 events um and how do you guys think events even like the one hosted here today in Milwaukee how do you guys think that these events or these types of events help with um in-person networking as you guys know web 3 is mostly online so I'd like to hear a little bit about your opinions with that yeah so these events are very important because in the web 3 ecosystem uh a lot of people tend to more Anonymous this helps put uh face value

07:42:32	and integrity uh towards the individuals that are building inside of the actual uh you know web 3 ecosystem itself but I feel like more is retained and better connections are made when it comes to web 3 when it's in person uh especially it doesn't matter even if you meet somebody uh online first and then meet them in person second or you meet them in person then you follow off online it's a great way and a great alternative to be able to actually you know meet people and further your or uh you know

07:43:01	further everything into a good fostering of a connection between two or multiple people I completely agree that's that's amazing actually yeah and I you know like touching on what Adam said the the importance of like connecting with people IRL um you know we build up these relationships online and in most cases we don't have the convenience of getting out to certain events all the time because it could be pretty expensive to attend a conference and so on but uh you know like the joy of getting together

07:43:31	after all this time of building and networking with these other projects like the energy is just undeniably like electric like the first time that Daniel and I actually met was at a Coden State event in New York I forget the restaurant but everyone was turning their head and like seeing the energy piping off of our like reserved area there was maybe you know like 15 projects couple people each team and so on um but the energy is undeniable and it's very contagious and you know I think that's what's very special about

07:44:02	capturing that and harnessing that with events yeah I I completely agree and other that we've been to like I said our fair share of events we've had a wonderful time and yeah the the energy is always truly electric it's actually funny you mentioned that the code State there remember he tried to give a presentation and everyone was just max energy it was amazing yeah uh then yeah we finally met in person and now we've been to so many of these you know so it's amazing to finally be uh to be to be a part of one like we are so yeah um

07:44:29	um next question I have for you guys is uh like how do you guys feel that these types of events benefit the education in the space how do you think it helps people learn about the space or become involved okay yeah yeah um I mean obviously as we can see with the pcpcc uh you know we're about I think 7 and a half hours in but there's a lot of educational content that everyone's been able to like get you know get educated on obviously like the animation videos breaking it down making it convenient

07:45:00	and now we're going to have a lot more people um repurposing that content creators kind of you know sifting through and reviewing it and I I think that's very important because we need to keep the information concise and transparent and real because there's a lot of issues with fake media and so on so I think as the more we get involved with these events and the more transparent we see and you know clear solid educational content um you know becomes more effective as we onboard new people into the blockchain industry you

07:45:29	know and that that's not just to say for ICP Cc or uh just any network you know to having real educative information all in a safe place is really important as we onboard new people because there's still people that struggle with using their phones uh like my parents sometimes uh so like you know the more informative the the content can be um it'd be great to to see as uh you know the challenging the tech is like excuse me sorry a little tired from the broadcast but uh but the challenging thing with like the education is you

07:46:06	know having just a solid source that people can always come back to like the ICP guide uh I believe it's icpg guide.com which is a great resource for learning about ICP um but yeah we need more places like that and the swap will eventually be a hub for stuff like that with education content so yeah and something a lot of people are just now learning how to do is um when it comes to facilitating a web 3 and participating in an ecosystem sometimes that's all you need for the first step is to actually take the leap

07:46:39	go and explore you know participate in the ecosystems itself you know learn how everything functions and there's a lot of uh you know confusion when it comes to onboarding about bringing people into the space and getting equated in education the first thing is just letting people jump in figure it out and then as they figure out how to navigate the ecos system a little bit educating them further when they have that uh you know a little bit of experience with using things and moving around a little

07:47:06	bit um so I see it as uh a clearer and quicker step towards adoption by letting people just interact seamlessly and making things heavy focused on the interfacing technology so yeah yeah I absolutely agree I think that's uh that's yeah both both wonderful answers and yeah definitely the web 3 event space is extremely helpful um I personally I like going and not only learning about other ecosystems and other projects and developments out there in the space but also just going out and uh and also teaching about the

07:47:38	stuff that that you know that we do and that we work on um so I I guess uh before we wrap up is there any final thoughts you guys have uh not not really a thought but um you know I'd like to shout out some of the members in the ICP Community uh Isabelle Garcia couldn't be here in Milwaukee with us today but I hope you're doing well uh Doug couter uh from discover uh slayen as well like uh just some of my close friends and people that we've worked with and had the pleasure of meeting uh just wanted to

07:48:05	give you guys a shout out cuz you've been phenomenal in the space um but yeah I'll give it over to Adam and if he has anything you'd like to add yeah I mean honestly one final thought I'd like to you know convey to everybody is if there's something you'd like to learn about you know uh dive deeper into the white paper or the light paper read about tokenomics read about uh you know the computer science behind how the tokens work don't be afraid to ask questions and and you know reach out to as many people as you can because the

07:48:32	person that you're sitting next to at a conference could very well be uh you know your next best friend to be somebody you navigate the ecosystem with so abolutely yeah amazing um uh yeah definitely I guess yeah definitely I would like to also shout out Isabelle she's been a total sweetheart great supporter all of our moderators all of our team it's been a pleasure you guys have helped us get here um it's been truly fantastic working with the entire ICB Community um including slayen we won't forget slayen

07:49:01	uh but hey guys thank you so much for this this has been an amazing chat I really enjoyed hearing both of you guys' opinions yeah yeah I look forward to chat more it's been great and I want to thank everyone that's came up for our panels I know we're you know wrapping up this panel right here but I do think we're coming into an airdrop so why don't we get to that and then we have a big announcement for you all so let's go [Music] all right and we are back uh so yeah now the moment that you've all been waiting

07:49:41	for we have six figs cracking FTX documentary now uh Kyle six figs has put in a tremendous amount of work into this documentary you're going to see multiple influencers make an appearance and this is about the whole story of the launch of ICP and honestly like I saw this today and I am blown away about the amount of work and effort that came in this is truly a remarkable documentary and I know you all are going to love it so tune in for this welcome back to the O show everything crypto every day I'm your

07:50:21	host you guys should know who I am um disclaimer I've got some amazing gentlemen here with me today and they're going to intro themselves in a moment your ni world [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I remember looking at the ICP chart CU we do coin requests basically we do I do a live stream on Sundays and we cover Bitcoin weekly cloth and then I'll take altcoin requests you know and you know from the community and we had some ICP requests so I took a look at the chart I remember back then and it literally

07:51:28	looked like a pump and dun and I just remember looking at it like I'm not going to touch this because when I'm in the trader mindset and I'm looking at a chart and I'm you know doing my my technicals for my trading and investing Journal I do like the technicals and the fundamentals like just looking at the technicals it didn't even want to make me look at the fundamentals because the chart was so ugly it looked like somebody pumped that thing up and then dumped it like 90% and generally when you see that in our industry it's it's

07:51:51	it's a rug pole like you ought automatically think that the team are scammers that the people associated with the project are scammers but in icps in sense it wasn't ICP was always interesting to me it was just when it launched I thought it would do well and then all of a sudden it collapsed and everybody saying it's a scam and all this and um you know so there was when I was much more interested I I knew the whole story I just didn't know the real story uh I I knew what we were being told about

07:52:25	everything so the charts were something that really kind of put that in perspective for me to to kind of look at those Rising prices and the collapse and shorting and all that so the biggest challenge for the internet computer protocol came immediately after the Genesis launch of ICP The Narrative at that time was that it's branded as a rug pull scam I want you guys to understand the entirety of how I was able to figure out that s bankman freed and FTX Alam research were creating synthetic assets

07:52:59	to wash projects out like ICP Ronin Network and a ton more and it all started on January 21st 2022 uh my name is Jeff I have a channel called Bitcoin Renegade and it's been a dream of mine to be on the windy O show so and so that led me to meeting you on her show which was insane it was crazy man years ago and you reached out like I I was so nervous that I probably wouldn't have reached out to you like I I didn't know you you know and it's crypto so but you were on crypto Wendy's show and you reached out to me and I was like hey

07:53:37	let's let's see who this guy is you know and then you just seem like a cool dude and I was like man you're cool so I'm going to I'm going to give you the the DL man and then you can you can do your research and find out if this is everything that I say it is create a wallet try it right that's what I told you and I kept looking at that chart thinking damn man man I can't expose my audience to this so anything I Googled or searched for on YouTube at the time was saying that it was a scam and I decided to one day just kind of lowkey

07:54:12	play around in the ICP ecosystem and quickly realized that this thing was the Bugatti of blockchains and really when it came down to it I didn't realize this at the time but now looking back there are a lot of dirty journalists who are very much pay to play I mean I think they been specifically it wasn't that they were just randomly scanning blockchain how do you prevent isues I want s i want you because you're on my business r i take the TR find that information and I send it to the police or I whatever articles from The New York

07:54:57	Times were the worst there was also a really sketchy video from an unknown company at the time named Arham intelligence which made ridiculous claims about the launch with some really bad graphs intense music and data Arkham intelligence was absolutely rotten and it was rotten of New York Times to not fact check and verify this Source when it comes to the data side of things that Aram was shelling out in those videos it's kind of interesting that they have still to this day omitted the IP and Ronin Network spot data from their

07:55:41	Explorer does that raise some red flags to this day they still omit that and in that video they had all sorts of data that they used to try to crush definity in the internet computer why is this why is this I'm genuinely interested but I needed to know why the price went down so much after the ICP token launched did all the tokens retrace that badly or was this just like an isolated incident so in early April May of 2021 I had been telling my audience on YouTube be on the lookout I think that there's a massive

07:56:19	crash coming why because there is a very bearish massive Rising wedge on the Bitcoin charts and it didn't occur to to me until I connected the dots that internet computer was launched at the very worst time [Music] possible it's a pure fact of the matter that any project launching on or around May 10th would have gotten hosed very badly in the following weeks or coming months but regardless I needed to find out if 80% retracements are just a norm in this crazy world we know as crypto I decided to take a look at the top 50

07:57:17	blockchains at that time in 2021 2022 and analyze postlaunch charts and really I looked at when the token launch down to the very first reversal low and then this happened a token dropping over 90% in the first month after launch is highly unusual for this is in fact very common vchain retraced 99% out of the gates a 99% cardano 98% Dogecoin 95% harar 96% xrp 90% near 87% ICP ultimately went on to retrace 96% but the list goes on and on so you can kind of see where I'm going with this but I still needed to find out as

07:58:09	much information as I possibly could about the launch so I basically scoured the internet looking for information that would tell me all of the exchanges that listed the ICP spot token at launch on May 10th 2021 my main focus was to start study the price exchange data and look for any anomalies that might stick out unfortunately I wasn't able to find anything out of the ordinary but I realized that I needed to look at this from a broader scope because Futures Trading is a thing in crypto and I realized that I would need to look at

07:58:52	all of the exchanges that offered Futures Trading on ICP at or around the line the six that I analyzed and they were the only ones that I could find at the time were Delta okx bitg binance huobi and FTX now I started kind of digging around in all the Futures exchange data and the last exchange I audited was FTX the first thing that kind of gave me a red flag was I noticed that FTX didn't show up on my spot price audit of all of the exchanges but now it's showing up on my Futures audit I thought this was kind of odd

07:59:37	that an exchange would offer Perpetual Futures but not spot trading of that same token and when I audited ftxs Futures data I noticed that FTX listed Perpetual Futures Trading of ICP for days before the token even launched what concerned me even more was that the price of ICP had been artificially pumped by over 440 prior to the launch of the ICP token but I needed to know if these listings in the Perpetual Futures Market prior to a token launch was a common thing so I went through all of the Delta

08:00:25	okx bitg binance huobi and FTX prior 5050 Perpetual Futures listings I must have went through 300 different listings looking at all this data interestingly enough though none of the other exchanges had ever listed any Perpetual Futures Trading ahead of a token launch but here FTX is with two incidents of this I found out that they listed Perpetual Futures Trading 4 days ahead on ICP and 20 days ahead on axi infiniti's Ronin Network this immediately raised red flags for me fact is I knew very little about Sam FTX

08:01:12	alamaa research at the time I started kind of looking into what Sam was investing his money into and Sam had been dumping hundreds of millions of dollars into the salana blockchain and ecosystem and with all due respect to the salana blockchain its leadership its ecosystem the community the launch of the internet computer which is a far superior blockchain was a very much a direct threat to Sam's Investments and I started to think that maybe FTX didn't offer spot tokens on their exchange because if their users started buying

08:01:52	the tokens it would interfere with their Perpetual Futures Market manipulation scheme the next question I had why Ronin Network I had to research what axi infinity and Ronin Network were Ronin Network at the time and axi infinti were absolutely killing it back in those days uh they were a top of the game they were the project that whenever you talked about nfts that they were brought up so you would think that they would explode out of the gate on their IPO not just completely just fall apart like that

08:02:25	it's it's unusual and it it might be I mean you could you could definitely say there was there circumstantial doubt was in my mind about certain things but there's some pretty big circumstances there and absolutely they were a big competitor to salana and we're talking about a single chain a single chain dedicated to a single project that was out competing an entire ecosystem of nfts so for Sam bankman to have an incentive to launch an attack on them I mean I it their the motive is absolutely there nfts as we know it were all the

08:03:03	rage in 2021 it was crazy and at the time axi Infiniti was the number one all-time nft collection by sales volume at over $4 billion in sales crypto punks was second board ape yach Club third mutant ape Yacht Club ranked fourth when it came down to alltime blockchain nft sales volume ethereum ranks first Ronin Network ranked second and salana was Far Behind respectively at rank number three I decided to look at the Ronin Network launch and the charts on FTX and like I said FTX launched Perpetual

08:03:49	Futures on Ronin Network 20 days before it launched within that 20 days prior to the Ronin Network token launch the value of the Ron token decreased 41% in the Perpetual Futures Market it's kind of strange that the value of a token can decrease at all especially if it's not even out yet what FTX did was create a tital wave of selling pressure prior to the launch of the Ron token and a few hours before the Ron token launched guess what the price of Ron spiked dramatically and over the next week it deteriorated and lost

08:04:36	another 56% in value the ICP and the Ron chart they look almost identical it's interesting here that mysteriously axi infiniti's Ron and network bridge would get hacked a month later for $650 million although I can't prove this I this is very speculative I suspect that Sam FTX and Alama had something to do with that like maybe connecting some hackers with a vulnerability in the r and network code that Sam FTX Alama might have uncovered when you showed me the data it it gave kind of a chill to my spine right

08:05:19	because some of it could be explained by coincidence but this is the thing when you have five six coincidences all lineup in a row like that um the chances of that happening are so low it's it's really damning I ended up drafting several articles called The Hitman of crypto this was a direct kneecap shot at one of the biggest influencers in all of crypto Sam bankman freed after Jordan peer-reviewed my work I released several YouTube videos and the findings through these articles I can remember the shock waves that went

08:05:59	through the ICP Community I had people from definity contacting me asking for more information there was a lot of excitement about this information that was coming to light the problem was that since the broader cryptoverse still saw ICP as a scam Sam bankman as this Golden Boy nobody cared outside of the ICP ecosystem they just didn't at that time I was extremely frustrated because I felt like I had the Smoking Gun to a murder trial and they would not let me admit it as evidence mons scai in my

08:06:39	investigative research on FTX really never gained too much traction outside of the ICP ecosystem but one day I'm sitting around and I'm watching Ben Armstrong bit boy crypto his live stream and he absolutely went off on Sam bankman freed something about stealing Ben's politician this bag is out here trying to tell you that only the suits know what to do only the suits only the people who have all the money they're the ones who can determine what happens no our bill is for the people and you're going to find this out we've got the

08:07:19	funding for it and it's coming out but guess what things are complicated now you want know why because let me tell you what FTX did let me tell you what s did okay this guy took our bill stole language from it actually stole language from our California state Bill our California state Bill stole language from it and put it in their bill what they're doing okay we were bring a bill for a digital asset commission where we were going to bring in a commission of 5 to seven people that going to work with

08:07:50	cftc it's going to be crypto people and lawyers uh some experts some bance people uh some Commissioners from cfdc and we wanted this board to kind of to crypto regulation and so we put that to FTX we gave that to FTX to Sam to look at maybe to fund our bill and they stole a lot of the ideas out of it and then they tried to steal Barbor boxer from us which is one of our lobbyists and I found out about it and she didn't go with him for good reason Barb boxer obviously is not currently a politician

08:08:19	but a long record and I think a lot of people know I mean Sam bribes people all the time and she didn't take the bait so good on her and if she report lobbying company what they had said and from there I realized he was actually trying to steal and rub pull my entire plan and put something different in and we talked to BR Harrison and and uh you know I think we had some connection with Sam himself and Mark wet Jen was the the guy there at FTX in charge of their regulation and and their you know

08:08:49	funding and lobbying efforts and so he was involved in this he was the one who actually talked to Barbara and tried to take her and so I was angry about this because will remember help you just were predatory on me and now the whole entire narrative Chang and actually he did in fact steal my bill I he wasn't the same one he was trying to do but he stole the opportunity from me because once FTX OCC obviously it put a halt on everything I was do it politically there was only one other person in this world at that time

08:09:19	that wanted Sam bankman freed as bad as I did and at this point I was exhausted trying to get this information out over many months I remember saying when I sat down to send Ben a DM as he was going off on his rager live streams that this is going to be the last time I'm ever going to try to bring this information to light usually these larger channels do not return random messages to people that they don't know but Ben sent a simple response you have information and I got this response as I was laying in bed checking crypto X for

08:10:02	the last time before I went to sleep I saw this and I may or may not have been butt naked but I jumped out of my bed flew into my office chair started sending Ben all this information everything I had how I found it tons of messages simple response back I'll have my team look at it and that was it and that was it here I've got some sort of Lifeline now which was great I was up the rest of the night wondering what was going to happen next I had no clue the next day I tune in to Ben's live stream I'm going

08:10:46	to do a review on ICP and do a fair shake well coincidentally coincidentally what if their bad reputation is because of Sam bacman Freedom got a lot of evidence to suggest that there was an orchestrated plan to crush ICP I got someone last night randomly sent me message after message with chart after chart with proof over proof now we've got to verify all this to be real and authentic before we do it we're doing that today and then we're going to record that video today and that video is going to come out on Saturday I was

08:11:20	given information charts and Analysis from a reliable source who wants to stay Anonymous for the purpose of this video but me and my research team of my fact Checkers well we've checked this out and the story is legit FTX has been pumping up the price of tokens prior to their launch and then dumping on retail investors and key projects in the space their target so far axi Infiniti and ICP I can remember after Ben's live stream I jumped out of my office chair screaming and cheering finally the word has been

08:11:54	sent out to a massive audience thanks to Ben and to Ben's credit he went on to discovering that FTX was involved in hosing lots of other projects once I start going viral and there's a lot of questions around F asked now all Sam's enemies start coming to me and I start getting information left and right and I start piecing together what's happening it's how I hooked up uh with new genesis uh it's how I hooked up with you it's how I hooked up with Reef it's how I hooked up with several other projects that I came and talk about who

08:12:27	didn't want to go public with this stuff major project top 100 top 20 projects well the one time top 20 project at least and so it was just kind of thing where I just started getting this information and for me I've always been quality over quantity like I love the fact that I have my DMs open where anyone can send DMS but it goes in a special folder so I can just go through them every once in a while and sometimes Tak days to go through them I just dig through and I find stuff and when there's active stuff going on I'm doing

08:12:54	it more because I'm getting more messages and there might be good information I I I didn't know who you were I had no idea who you were but I did know that you were a person that was sending me something and I clicked on the video was like wait this guy's got something here so when it comes down to it after Ben's live streams people understood that FTX was facing some insolvency issues and had printed lots of synthetic tokens for its users on it on its Exchange okay so it is now uh March 11th 1:14 a.m. I know if you guys

08:13:36	can see that and I'm here in Las Vegas and it's been going down and I've got a gentleman sitting here that was very integral after I had discovered what I discovered with ICP and Ronin Network and I was supposed to meet up with you in Tokyo Japan but obviously things didn't work out we are exercising the most anonymity with this because we're not going to jeopard jeopardize your identity and like I promise like I will uphold the like 100% of most ethical journalistic standards I will I don't even know who you are

08:14:19	there's no way I can even contact you because I've tried contacting you especially after like the Tokyo thing and now you're here and this is the last night of the shoot in Vegas I got to fly out in the morning um so thank you for being here I didn't think that I would ever be sitting here with you um but when it comes down to it you were telling me I believe you saw one of my videos on FTX Ronin Network and ICP and you reached out to me and like some of the stuff that you were telling me that was going on was just like crazy

08:14:58	so like what were the first things that you kind of noticed like or you you and your people noticed uh about FTX we cut on the FTX ear on uh in particular there was a project that contacted us when they got impacted by by FTX so a project that was trying to work with FTX that the deal fell through right so what happened is uh FTX would recruit projects to The Exchange so that they could act as a uh Market maker for the token FTX typically would require a large percentage of tokens up front for for liquidity

08:15:50	purposes they would also require the source code to the tokens which is well look fine what FTX would do is then sell these tokens on other exchanges once they got listed using their Enterprise accounts then they would create synthetic assets to trade on their own exchange on FTX and that's kind of what we saw like that was one of the first things that I saw when it came down to FTX um W basically bombing out ICP and Ronin Network like Reef Celsius like there's a whole bunch of other stuff but it was

08:16:36	like more on the Perpetual future side of things where they were creating these synthetics and that's kind of what I discovered early on was that there's creating tokens that aren't even in existence like the Chain's not even like the coin's not even trading now we know this is we know this the case cuz uh one project actually backed out with FTX um and under the agreement that the two parties would separate then then the tokens would be returned FTX attempted to return all the tokens to the project but the train

08:17:17	wouldn't accept them why well they have given FTX a slightly altered source code the chain just wouldn't accept the to the liquidity tokens that they had given them because FTX had sold those tokens on an Enterprise account and then had minted these synthetic tokens and tried to send them back to the project so that's what happened infinite money and it had moved all the legitimate tokens off of the exchange or given them away or squandered them somewhere FTX collapses a month later sadly the circumstances of ftxs collapse validated

08:18:06	all this research that I had done 8 months earlier and when you look at all these YouTube videos or articles now the rug pole articles and claims that plagued the internet computer and definity are gone to definity these credit they have not stopped shipping incredible products and updates to the IC but when it comes down to reversing this terrible rug pull claim the community is the the the the ones that put all the hard work in they have been out there sharing some of this work educating the cryptoverse and I don't

08:18:52	think there has ever been a greater comeback and guys that's the story of how I cracked FTX and how all this stuff came to light it's by far one of the most crazy experiences of my life and my advice is that whenever you're doing your own research investigate everything when you are doing your research it's not as simple as watching YouTube Tik Tok or scrolling X sure that's helpful but at the end of the day you are responsible for clicking that buy and sell button and you better make damn sure you're buying something good it's

08:19:34	cost me quite a bit of money to create this V this film when it comes down to it though at the end of the day it's not about the money it's about providing information that is for the greater good of the internet computer community ecosystem definity this is all I care about I think I found a top a we got here 100 keep it 100 the internet computer got anything you wanted it's the everything blockchain it really is the centralized simplified no fees to leave you penalized big time scalability is infinite you never got to leave the

08:20:20	ecosystem once you ENT it I'm deep diving checking out the dashboard they got every single thing thing that I could ask for plus more utility I want that canister structure was more than a smart contract I bought the dip cuz it's a different type of crypto I had a little bit but it's legit I'm about to get more the backbone of web 3 is built to be the number one and time will see but me I'm in it for the long run I IP yeah I IP as far as I can see the future's looking bright to me I H IP yeah I H IP the future web 3 is feeling

08:20:57	real nice to me de centralized cloud and it don't need oracles they found a way to bundle codes and then storage those check it bro yeah I'm talking about the technicals the nfts are way more than Collectibles and nah this ain't a me more shitcoin look at how they bringing superow straight to bitcoin a few hundred daps already build on it one day there will probably be a mill on it meanwhile I get rewards from the governance tell Domin Williams that I am loving this more transactions than any chain in this real they built the world

08:21:33	computer and it's a big deal I H IP yeah I IP as far as I can see the future looking bright to me I IP yeah I [Music] and now we're back to the final I'm just playing we're back with the ICPC I was trying to sound like the hacker there in Kyle 6figs uh film it was a great documentary shout out to Kyle and everyone involved with producing the cracking FTX documentary make sure you're sharing that to help bring awareness to what is going on and you know helping Kyle uh with getting the awareness about that because it was a

08:22:23	personally funded uh documentary so um now we're coming into the closing you know countdown of like our final prime time slot because we've been going for over eight hours now and I'm a little bit beat but we're going to wrap up here soon and you know I do want to thank everyone that made today possible it's been a tremendous job I hope you've all been enjoying it and you know give a you know Round of Applause for COD and state and everyone involved our sponsors Media Partners to make today absolutely

08:22:52	special um but now I do want to get you guys into the countdown because we're going going to the prime time slot [Music] [Music] [Music] ICP is an innovation beyond what is possible for what we thought of the internet the reason why I love ICP is because of its amazing community and we know for sure that we're going to the moon the world's first dcent centralized web services blockchain we're essentially trying to create a new internet decentralized and open for everybody ICP smart contracts can secure

08:24:36	assets on any network Ki technology is awesome and the on governance that IP is doing is great the community found this amazing technology and we care so much about it we're so passionate about it so we're almost the aliens bunch of freaks have come over worked on the same platform and build some of the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life using ICP is just like deploying to the cloud it's out of this world smart contract canister can literally control Smart contracts from all other [Music]

08:25:12	chains all right and we are back pcpcc and you know as I mentioned we're coming into our prime time here with our American audience and demographic because we started this nine hours ago can you believe it I certainly feel it but yeah as we've mentioned earlier with this Global broadcast we've had 23 locations meet up worldwide and from what I was told we're about I think around 7,000 viewers at one point live um and I do want to take a moment to thank Cod and state again for allowing us to be able to host this event in

08:25:43	Milwaukee very like I can't thank you enough Cedric Isaac estabon and everyone else involved seriously can't thank you enough um I do also want to repeat our sponsors that also help provide and make this possible possible so real quick I'm going to shout out omnity bitfinity IX dmail clown geek Factory Nuance bionic Elna Loca mining open chat X Dragon Vault bet ICP swap catalyze Cyclops Cosmic rafts and ory and then again I want to kick back to our Media Partners um and we were featured on coin

08:26:21	Telegraph today which is a massive accomplishment uh for This Global broadcast so thank thank you coin Telegraph thank you crypto slate blockchain Bill blockchain pill sorry sorry Alex uh be in crypto and then of course our team here at the Swap who I hope you all enjoyed our broadcast we've been going for a long time uh so seriously give us any feedback uh for next year uh I want to thank our production team and everyone involved you guys crushed this for us so thank you um and now we're going to go into a

08:26:52	welcome statement from lamesh Duda from definity Foundation so let's go check that out welcome ipcc my name is Kyle langum I'm the director of data and analytics at definity and I am really really excited to celebrate the third anniversary of ICP here with you if you're not familiar the definity foundation it is the largest R&D operation in blockchain space it boasts over 200 Engineers research and developers cryptographers in fact is the largest employeer of cryptographers in the Private Industry

08:27:30	that's important because to build ICP required countless Innovations in cryptography and so you need that technical expertise in order to build a tech platform as complicated as ICP and as useful so get involved join this community uh be excited that you are now part of the internet's next Revolution see you out there [Music] all right uh lsh looked a little different there because it was Kyle Langham so my apologies on that uh Kyle you did great there with the welcome statement uh and I hope you all caught

08:28:23	that airdrop alert right there make sure you type in that code uh and all airdrops will be dispersed uh 48 hours after the conclusion of the pcpcc so make sure you're submitting those codes properly so that you can be qualified for those aird drops now I do want to take a moment to give a shout out to all the locations worldwide and forgive me because I will probably butcher some of these city names uh but anyways we have bullan Shire uh Nairobi coochi cira colum uh Jen Berlin Bali sonola carcass

08:28:57	uh buenos Ares shout out to inside dark Studio love you guys Yola kalala I think crypto girls there uh Costa Del cpra capara uh and then we have London K nooka and then Miami Silicon Valley New York City Washington DC Milwaukee of course everyone here um and then Austin which Coden State's also there and Kula Lampur San ago de chili um and yeah I just want to thank everyone for taking the time out of their day to make this special for all of us this is the second annual pcpcc and I do also want to

08:29:37	remind you that we do have the pcpcc SNS St tomorrow that's going to start at 1500 UTC so if you want to participate I would say listen here carefully because the first 880,000 ICP raised will have a multiplier reward for those that choose to participate so that's completely up to to you if you choose to do so but why don't we figure out for anyone uh that might be tuning in to the broadcast for the first time how about we educate you on what is ICP so let's cut to that now web 3 is the future but it's still much harder to use

08:30:10	than web 2 the industry is fragmented across many blockchains forcing web3 Builders to choose between difficult compromises in centralization versus usability these compromises were only necessary because web 3 was incomplete in May 2021 this all changed with the launch of the internet computer protocol or ICP ICP is a decentralized cloud that Bridges the gap between web 2 and web 3 to create ICP over 100 cryptographers worked for eight years to perfect an utterly new cryptography Innovation it's

08:30:48	called chainkey technology but before we explain how it works let's quickly look at the incredible things ICP can do first let's explore how decentralized applications on ICP can pair with web 2 applications ICP has a powerful new type of smart contract called canisters they are decentralized web servers that can directly host full websites with low latency canisters can store up to 400 GB of data perform complex calculations and connect to web2 services and apis without oracles users don't pay gas on

08:31:28	ICP when canisters do computations they burn a token called Cycles from a built-in wallet this process is called a reverse gas model gas costs on ICP usually get paid by the core teams or Dows that own the canisters but some daps collect assets to cover their gas costs themselves the Cycles needed to run canisters can only be minted by burning ICP tokens and the mint ratio get stabilized against the real world costs of running the physical nodes that are doing the computation the cost of Hosting daps on ICP is consistent and

08:32:06	inexpensive regardless of whether the price of ICP tokens goes up or down the result is that canisters can deliver decentralized web experiences that look and feel indistinguishable from web 2 next let's look into how ICP connects with the web 3 world most web 3 blockchains require Bridges to connect to other chains bridges are built by deploying smart contracts on each chain and relaying transactions between them relaying transactions across chains often involves expensive cryptography computation multisig wallets between

08:32:45	trusted parties and offchain oracles the complicated architecture of web 3 Bridges makes them slow costly difficult to use and prone to security breaches ICP canisters can directly sign transactions on other blockchains such as Bitcoin and ethereum without Bridges or centralized service providers canisters can mint ordinals on bitcoin deploy smart contracts on ethereum and do anything a human user can do across different web 3 blockchains effectively making them decentralized autonomous web 3 users the result is that ICP can

08:33:23	abstract away the complexity of multi-chain transaction so that users can enjoy a seamless web experience chain key technology the alien Tech powering ICP makes these incredible capabilities possible to understand chain key let's review how typical web 3 secret Keys work when a web 3 user wants to create a new blockchain transaction they sign a message to the blockchain using a secret key that only they know a threshold signature is when one secret key gets broken up in into pieces held by different nodes in a network together

08:34:00	these nodes can collectively sign messages without ever revealing the entire secret key to any node in the network governments and militaries have been using threshold cryptography to protect their most valuable Secrets since the 9s however these organizations only execute threshold signatures within controlled private networks blockchain networks must be public trustless and decentralized web 3 nodes might be offline or malicious and an attacker might even try to collect the pieces of the secret key

08:34:33	over time secure threshold signatures on web 3 were impossible until the definity foundation invented chain key technology with chain key up to onethird of nodes could be offline or malicious and the network can still generate a secure signature the pieces of the secret key stored on each node are also constantly scrambling so that any information leaked from a node is useless to attackers this makes it possible to create a decentralized network that can use secret Keys No human or computer will ever know

08:35:09	definity built ICP on top of chainkey technology to completely reimagine what an L1 blockchain could be with the vision of creating a fully decentralized internet for example anyone can verify the content received from the internet computer by simply valid validating a signature without sinking the entire blockchain in addition 0% of ICP nodes run on AW us or other big Tech Cloud providers ICP nodes are themselves independent private clouds running in data centers all over the world furthermore nodes on ICP only act as

08:35:46	vendors for an onchain Dow that manages an ICP Network called the network nervous system or nns ICP holders who stake tokens in the nns are the only ones who can control the source code of the network and they can collectively update the network without hard Forks ICP is entirely alien to anything else within web 2 or web 3 which makes it perfect for connecting the two in ways never possible before with Bitcoin Humanity got the first decentralized network with ethereum Humanity got the first decentralized logic with ICP

08:36:23	Humanity now has the first decentral ized secret Keys the first decentralized cloud and the first decentralized AI models oh yeah did we mention that ICP is the only blockchain that can fully host AI models on chain now that is alien Tech the future of the internet belongs to everyone and it won't be harder to use whatever blockchains you love and whatever web 3 future you're fighting for icp's alien Tech will be a part of it explore what ICP has to offer and and take your place in the web 3 Invasion all right and we are back

08:37:06	internet computer enjoyers uh so that was a great video learning about internet computer protocol and real quick uh I will mention we're about to come into our segment with uh Bitcoin ICP and Bitcoin integration so you might be familiar with chain key Bitcoin and I will you know kind of mention briefly you know ICP had Bitcoin integrated for quite a long time I believe it was February 2023 where we first introduced the Bitcoin integration uh I recall being with some of the definity contractors and employees uh at the

08:37:41	Bitcoin Miami Conference where we helped bring awareness to CK BTC so you know you're going to come into the segment where you're learning more about the interoperability with internet computer protocol so I would like to take a moment as well to mention to the ICP Community the the real need you know for this upcoming Bitcoin Nashville we should get as many of you together in Nashville to help spread awareness to CK BTC I know definity has hinted at doing an event downtown around the conference

08:38:13	and our team from the swap is already going to be there for media coverage so uh I would love to see as many of you out as possible so this is my call to action to you please get out and help us with spreading the awareness around ckb so we can help spread adoption but now let's get into the ICP BTC integration [Music] video I would say that there are four main components to the ICP BTC integration the first one is there's a Bitcoin light node running fully on chain on ICP that means that if you want

08:38:47	to know you know what your Bitcoin balance is you don't have to query an offchain node you can just query the Bitcoin node running on ICP and you can get the balance for that address it also means you can get the utxos which are the unspent transaction outputs for that particular Bitcoin address so the Bitcoin node running fully on chain is the first the second one is you have the tecsa subnet which lets you directly sign Bitcoin L1 transactions from an ICP smart contract it also enables you to

08:39:18	actually have a Bitcoin address in your ICP smart contract an ICP smart contract can hold Bitcoin receive Bitcoin and it can send Bitcoin and this is like L1 Bitcoin it's also what enables other kinds of uh Bitcoin asset custody in ICP smart contracts so the tcdsa subnet is is the second one the third one is cbtc uh so you can take your Bitcoin you can lock it up in the ICP protocol and you can get wrapped version of Bitcoin called CK BTC and CK BTC it's 10 SATs to transfer and it's really fast you know 2

08:39:47	to 5 Second transaction times so cbtc is a really nice Innovation that kind of enables us to leverage Bitcoin assets on ICP and the fourth one is an ordinals Bridge you can take your Bitcoin ordinals and you can take them and put them into the internet computer protocol and mint tokens on the other side similar to cbtc we've built that one at at bionic and those are the four components that make it really nice as developers to build Bitcoin applications directly on ICP Bitcoin is very limited in what you

08:40:21	can do a lot of people say Bitcoin doesn't have Smart contracts technically it does it's just extremely limited it's called Bitcoin script you can go and you can lock up your funds right now in a multisig and specify how those funds can be spent and so the trick with a very limited base layer like Bitcoin is how do you build on top of it and so right now there are dozens and dozens like probably 50 plus different protocols where people are trying to build interesting Solutions directly on top of

08:40:46	Bitcoin and it's all a game of tradeoffs there are some Bitcoin layers like stacks for example sta has a really interesting model where they have something coming called sbtc is similar in functionality to cbtc but has taken different trade-offs and so there are different pros and cons for example sbtc has an economic security model meaning you have Anonymous peggers that are actually staking funds and then based on their staking then they're allowed to you know vote for Bitcoin to go in and out of that bridge on the cbtc side it's

08:41:14	more at the protocol level you don't have that Economic Security but you do have legal security as all of the node providers on ICP are known entities that have kyc I've been saying for a while now that I think the easiest way to build a Bitcoin application is to build it on ICP right now the reason is you have Bitcoin already bridged you have an ordinal Bridge we have a brc2 bridge prototype that we have right now um we'll have a runes Bridge as well once runes comes out in in April that the having because

08:41:47	you can have your ICP smart contract hold Bitcoin in a Bitcoin address because of the tcdsa subnet that just opens up all kinds of interesting functionality and possibilities also having HTTP out calls directly from an ICP smart contract is extremely powerful in interacting with Bitcoin directly or even with another blockchain like ethereum you know having the power of wasm based smart contracts you can write python or JavaScript or rust smart contracts and interact with the full programmability of ICP leveraging the

08:42:19	Bitcoin Integrations uh to build for Bitcoin feels pretty powerful there are a number of ways right now one is to definitely check out bionic really excited about what we're putting out into the world with bionic and it's really easy to sign up just go to bionic that's bionic with the Q at the end. uh you can log in it's just oneclick log in using Google off and then you have a built-in Bitcoin wallet and a built-in bionic wallet and so it's really easy to uh send Bitcoin into your bionic wallet

08:42:50	you can convert it right there in our UI you can convert it over to CK BTC with the necessary 13 Bitcoin conf confirmations and then you have CK BTC you can easily buy and sell ordinals on the bionic Marketplace using CK BTC and it will feel like a nice you know nft Marketplace because we're built entirely on ICP [Music] all right I hope you caught that airdrop from Windows 98 shout out to Shi Gates uh and yeah we just learned about the ICP BTC integration which is obviously very special for our Network um and you

08:43:42	know I'd like to take the moment to get you guys prepared for the next segment which is going to be the ICP Soul integration which is known as the galactic Bridge which just went live the other day so I do want want to help you all and please help me with this too because we need to bring awareness to getting a lot of salana users to start adopting the ICP Galactic Bridge uh for the network so let's keep you know doing our great job of spreading awareness to get others informed about what benefits

08:44:14	we can offer the other ecosystem and help onboard these people so we can make a lasting impact for years to come so let's go into this video and we'll be back soon [Music] first of all I'm happy to be part of this conversation and I want to say hello to everyone from the ICP Community my name is Tito and basically I have a blockchain development and consulting company along with my co-founder CI we are doing this for the last five six years we really enjoy the the blockchain space being building different stuffs

08:44:50	from different protocols but found at ICP this year and we enjoy the technology it's super awesome we believe that the most important asset of every chain is their community and the contributors that are building their own Solutions their own Alternatives Galactic Bridges it's a mood chain protocol that allow you to move assets from one chain to another you can connect your plug wallet or some other kind of web extension and you can also connect your Phantom wallet it starts with sonana but I think that we can

08:45:20	expand to other chains as well the protocol is flexible enough and Universal enough that can can bring many other chains so soan is maybe only the first so our main goal is to make it user friendly and super easy for even non crypto natives I think that in the future ICP will become a hub for multichain communication swaps and tokens so I think that infrastructure pieces like Galactic Bridge CK BTC CK e and other similar projects will be driving force back in the days we were building another cross chain protocol

08:45:52	that was connecting Bitcoin eth another chain and it was insanely hard we have to develop smart contracts on every separate chain but with ICP one of the most impressive things in my opinion is this cheny cryptography and the threshold ecdsa my point is that on IP you can natively make the cross chain communication super smoothly super decentralized the most Advanced Technologies that I haven't seen on any other blockchain especially on layer one we are building Galactic Bridge because it's alternative to the native chain key

08:46:27	integration basically with our approach we can support any kind of chain without waiting for a new integration to be done on ICP and support a new signature it's just an alternative to what the definity foundation is doing and I believe that the more Alternatives you have and the more decentralized solutions and more solutions the system have the better [Music] all right pcpcc we are back and we're getting into the final moments here where still got a bit of time don't want you all to leave yet uh but I do want to

08:47:05	take a moment to just acknowledge again real quick uh that we are doing hash ipcc 2024 on socials so get out there spread awareness about what's going on and what we have here um you know and real quick I do also want to go in and acknowledge our next next speaker which is going going to be Sebastian who also created the galactic airdrop so all the airdrop alerts that you've been getting and feeding in that code Sebastian is behind that but let's get over to a Moko boot camp testimonial here from one of

08:47:38	our graduates and then learn about Sebastian's announcement that he has coming for Mako boot camp and then let's kick off uh give all your attention to Seb because he's got a major announcement for you all and then we're going to go into an ICP project showcase so let's go to that hi everyone I am boan a proud graduate of the MCO boot camp after leaving my traditional programming job I ventured in the world of web tree development I discovered the moku boot camp through a Twitter ad and it immediately C my

08:48:12	attention the promise of mastering Dow Creation in just one week was too good to pass up so I took the leap spending a week in Madrid for this intensive course was transformative Guided by the amazing SE I not only grasp the fundamentals of DS but also was inspired by the Vibrant Community of Builders around me the project I developed is called Green Guild a self- sustaining camping resort bringing my childhood Vision to life in the realm of web tree you can manage Dow members join easily and handle different

08:48:47	roles members can also add proposals vote on them and manage funds clearly and safely the project is still in progress but one day I will realize my dream I believe if you're aiming to make a significant career shift and Innovative in the web tree space I highly recommend to joining MCO boot camp it's more than just learning it's about creating and being part of the future bye-bye [Music] oh hey hello everyone yes I am interrupting the live stream from my room I have an important invitation to share with all of you but before that we

08:49:38	are celebrating the third anniversary of the internet computer and during those three years there is a question that I've been asked so many times why the internet computer over any other ecosystem for me everything started 3 years ago when I was learning Moto and decided to drop out of school the same year then 2 years ago I started teaching Moto and together with other people we run the first edition of moto boot camp and it was pretty cool then one year ago around the same time as the first ICP

08:50:07	Community Conference other people started to run their own edition of moto boot camp around the world and it was also pretty cool Beyond any price pitch or feature there is something that resonated with all of the students that have ever met a vision today I want to talk talk about this vision and today I also want to tell you how we are going to make it real so what is this Vision Moto boot camp is not just about teaching Moto the programming language it's about transmitting Moto the spirit have you

08:50:41	ever wondered what Moto means in Japanese Moto means Foundation I choose the internet computer because the blockchain revolution is not about putting an old system on the chain it's about rebuilding a new one it's about about rebuilding New Foundations today I am officially graduating from Coden State thanks guys for your amazing support and today I am announcing the next chapter of moto boot camp we are building a school together I believe Dows are the OBS for the next Industrial Revolution I believe Dows will Empower

08:51:14	communities and individuals across the globe I believe Dows will unlock a new wave of Innovations like never seen before imagine a school for entrepreneurs that share the same vision imagine a school to master the power of the internet computer this summer I will be building the foundation for this school in public with all of you doesn't matter if you are a builder an investor a Community member or just curious you are all welcome to join us welcome to the open internet summer [Music] hey there my name is tashar and I'm the

08:51:58	founder of rubu on traditional web tool platforms creators are at the mercy of centralized control which leaves both creators and consumers undervalued and frustrated at rubu we are flipping the script we are building a decentralized platform where creators retain complete ownership of their profiles and content stored securely on chain supercharged by ICP no more central control no more opaque algorithms plus our permissionless creator consumer incentive program ensures that user receive image and fair incentive for

08:52:26	their creation and engagement join us as we pineer a new era in the digital content [Music] landscape origin was built on the internet computer to bring to life the world's most powerful digital certificates allowing it to store and run everything on chain from digital authenticity artifacts to 3D volumetric videos and even Marketplace daps existing entirely within an nft origin has since enabled the creation of digital twins for fractionalized art luxury goods diamonds goods made 100% in country and now also gold the final

08:53:07	layer in this cake is now pan industrial a global integrator with broad industry and web 3 experience engaged across taxation lending carbon offsets Insurance entertainment and much more these often large multi-year projects are migrating Global Commerce to real web 3 and of course most often underpinned by origin the internet computer and yes even a gold back stable [Music] coin welcome to ory your trusted Gateway for decentralized Oracle and automation powered by internet computer protocol our system consists of two main modules

08:53:48	cble and Pia our star module Syble Bridges the gap between the real world data and blockchain cble makes decentralized data fetching from various of sources signs it with robust encryption and cashes it for secure decentralized access developers can retrieve this data with proof and attach it to user transactions once confirmed by the verifier contract this data infuses life into your smart contracts business logic next up meet pythia our versatile automation module that feels at home across various

08:54:21	blockchains pythia can automate transactions on various chains it can either fetch price feeds from cble generate Randomness or execute pure automation transactions these transactions are executed based on a set frequency or condition and delivered to the desired contract method on the respective chain with orally developers can establish subscriptions for real-time updates fueling their contracts on various chains with real world data and promoting fully decentralized operations for their business logic picture a defi project

08:54:54	getting live price updates from civil or prediction Market platforms they can use pythia for the automated execution of bets when certain conditions are met this eliminates the need for centralized intervention and increases operational efficiency or imagine a gaming platform that needs random number generation they can leverage pythia for probably fair and On Demand Randomness essential in games for tasks like generating random scenarios or Distributing in-game rewards orally is reshaping the future

08:58:21	Camp announcement we also had great projects featured in our Prime Time showcase so shout out to you all uh and then there was also an airdrop in there um and I just want to remind you all that we had $11,000 in aird drops today so if you punched in the code you qualified to potentially receive part of that airdrop and that will be dispersed in the next 48 hours after the pcpcc concludes now I do also want to take the time to mention that ipcc had a contest for best meme so make sure you use # ipcc and tag the ICP CC account and show

08:58:58	us those best memes because 10 ICP is going to go out to the winner um but yeah I real quick I'm going to do a quick transation for you we're going to go into the ease of building on ICPC ipcc and ICP analytics and then we're going to gear up to potentially close the broadcast we're approaching that 9 hour mark actually we just hit it but yes let's get into those videos quick and then we have some more special announcements for you [Music] so yeah before I talk about the grants program um I wanted to give like just a

08:59:37	take a step back and kind of talk about what makes ICP special and what kind of like activities like teams are what what they're building um on the protocol so unlike any of the blockchain that you know of today so most of the blockchains are essentially like it's a ledger with token which says I want to transfer some tokens from a person a to person B and The blockchain Ledger keeps a record of that transaction it also has like some metadata which is a URL pointing so to some nfts somewhere that basically like

09:00:07	limits to the extent of what you can do on the blockchain so you can do some defi stuff nfts and and and and so on what ICP on the other hand is a very different Paradigm right so you're saying okay you can run these full step applications which can basically include your front ends back ends uh you can literally try to build decentralized versions of lots of different things right so imagine you're building a game uh you can say oh given my entire game is running on chain how about I mint the level seven of my game as an nft and

09:00:35	kind of give exposure to people so that's the kind of thing so it's not just like crypto defi but you can really try to think of decentralized version of um a search engine uh like a GitHub and so on and so forth point is that like ICP brings a much wider canvas on what you can build and because of that the way we look at our grants program so we do have a $250 million grant program uh through which the definity foundation uh supports entrepreneurs and Builders but the reason why I was talking about all

09:01:04	that stuff is because the way we view our grants program is that we don't really want to fully box our thinking and saying okay this is what we think could be done on the protocol we also want great ideas from entrepreneurs like you who says okay I feel that this is something that you may not even even thought of but it's possible on IP and I would like to give it a shot so yes we do support um new entrepreneurs with Amazing Ideas which we haven't thought of uh to come and build that uh we have

09:01:30	grants for infrastructure how do you build canisters on ICB improving infrastructure improving languages building tools that helps developers but all in all I think it's more about we we want to constantly learn in trades so any any amazing idea that you have that you feel should be built in this world uh come and apply for our grants [Music] hi my name is Kyle langum I'm the director of data and analytics at definity over the past three years ever since the Genesis event we've seen just non-stop growth and I'm going to put

09:02:10	some data behind that so what we're looking at here in this chart is the uh Cycles burned per month over the last 2 and a half years we've been averaging somewhere around 8 to 9% month over Monon growth what you see on this first chart is is essentially the growth in developers from going all the way back to 2020 zooming forward to the end of last year so over about a fouryear span uh you can see the internet computer is the fifth fastest growing ecosystem in developers that is despite the fact that

09:02:39	the internet computer didn't even go live until 2021 this next chart I'm showing you again is from the Electric Capital 2023 report that came out in January of this year I'm going to just point out in that that darker green area ICP stands alone uh that is the area that um basically chains that saw greater than 50% growth last year in 2023 in developer counts kind of is in Stark comparison to a lot of the orange and the red you see which are negative numbers so actually the industry really struggled last year and ICP is clearly

09:03:09	the outlier um seeing a lot of strong growth so developers are coming to the internet computer primarily because they can build applications that aren't possible on web 2 Tech stxs so then the other metric we want to look at is the number of people using ICP now that's a lot harder to get to and I'm going to show this slide here one way to estimate the number of new users coming into the ICP ecosystem is through internet identities going back into 2023 we're averaging somewhere between 4,000 new

09:03:40	internet identities per month and that's been growing in 2024 you see kind of moving up into the close to that 5,000 range and then in April a huge Skyrocket a lot of new uh users coming into the internet computer us using the different apps uh that are available and uh we expect to continue to see um new internet identities continue to grow we can also track existing users um so these are users who have been using internet identity uh in the past and uh how many unique ones there are again this one is this chart that I'm showing

09:04:14	here is the number of unique active internet identities and this is just a nice up and the right chart what you can see in this chart is essentially the amount of ICP that has been swapped in the decentralization swaps uh for snss uh you can see the first one occurred back um in uh March of 2023 so we have about a year of this happening and you see this nice little stair step for each SNS that came through you can see the average volume per day of CK BTC transactions has really ballooned in 2024 this really kind of corresponds

09:04:48	very well with the rise and awareness of Bitcoin l2s also you see uh again one of these beautiful up and to the right charts of the average number of transactions for CK BTC growing uh we went from just a few hundred in August of 2023 now we're averaging over 3,000 transactions per day uh we continue to expect that to expand again as the market becomes more and more aware of Bitcoin l2s of using Bitcoin on other chains ICP is well positioned uh in that manner one of the things you would like to see is continued interest and demand

09:05:22	in staking on the nns this chart I'm showing you right here is going all the way back to 2022 and this is the the amount of millions of ICP that are being staked on the nns that are newly coming into the governance system really what you want to see are people who are um interested in this who are active uh and you can see we've been averaging around let's say 1 and a half to two million ICP per month maybe actually a little bit higher and then the alternative to that is how much ICP is coming off of

09:05:52	the nns uh how many people are coming out of governance and you can see in this chart here moving forward that number is going down pretty significantly you see right now we're averaging probably around 1 and A5 million maybe a little bit lower ICP coming off of the nns everything you're looking at here is significantly lower than what we've seen the historical average which was closer to 3 and a 3/4 million ICP per month ICP continued its incredible growth in 2022 and 2023 during the bare Market you're seeing now

09:06:23	the markets coming we're in a great position to continue that growth and even amplify it if you want to keep in touch if you're a data person like me and you want to keep uh your hand and your your attention on uh how the metrics are shaping out best place to go to is dashboard. internetcomputer dorg thank [Music] you all right we just heard from lamesh and Kyle and I just want to say it was a pleasure to hear from both of those goats they're definitely a major contributor to the the internet computer

09:07:00	ecosystem because they're both from definity Foundation I had the pleasure of meeting Kyle Langham last year at the Bitcoin Miami Conference during when there was a time you might have heard all the Kyles uh set there was a city that set the record for most kyes in one city at one time uh they had a meeting and Kyle and I recently choked about that so maybe in Bitcoin Nashville Kyle maybe we can set the record this year so let's get a bunch of people out from ICPC and get them to spread the great

09:07:29	word about ckbc uh real quick uh I do want to mention we're going to go into the ICPC SNS Dow um Johan is going to be talking about that and I just want to remind you all that tomorrow the pcpcc SNS Dow will be going live at 1500 UTC and again I will mention the first 880,000 ICP raised will have a multiplier reward if you're early in reaching the uh fundraising goal for that da uh to to finalize um so again the first 80,000 ICP raised in that will qualify for a multiplier so you could be rewarded for

09:08:10	participating early um but yes let's uh hear from uh Johan Hartman and then we're going to go up into wrap wrap up session sorry tongue twister after a 9-h hour broadcast we're coming down to the final stretch but let's hear from Johan and then we'll do the wrap-up [Music] session hi everyone this is Johan speaking today we'll be covering a few important terms uh in regards to Dows on the internet computer protocol the first term we'll be looking at is the nns so what is the nns it is actually the Dow

09:08:52	that runs the internet computer protocol Network it's also the only way to update the source code of the protocol and it's actually extremely interesting because it puts the token holders in charge over node providers or even core developers a second and interesting term are neurons so what are neurons once you have your tokens you can stake them in neurons which will grant you governing rights you can also follow other neurons for voting which is extremely uh interesting in terms of liquid democracy the last

09:09:21	term I would like to go through is uh the SNS so what's an SNS it is a dow created on a lunch pad which is on the nns it has gasless decentralized front end it gives the availability for D to have a fully unchain treasury with no custodians as a user it becomes extremely interesting because you can own and manage tabs let's move on to the iccc so what is the IC PCC Dao LLC you first have to know that the iccc is the first and largest event Series in the ICB ecosystem right now it is uh being launched as a SNS dowo hopefully it will

09:09:56	become a community-owned and fully self-sustaining decentralized conference event series devoted to highlighting the icp's technology and ecosystem what will this dowo do exactly going into 2025 the ICPC dowo will host two type of events per year we will host a multi-day conference like the one last year in 2023 as well a global live stream like this year's event it is also key to know that all tickets VIP perks and merch will be collected in the native token and go straight back to the Dow treasury

09:10:26	along with all the proceeds from event sponsorships so how will this work exactly right now the ICBC event is being launched into a SNS Dow with three specific components the first one to know is that the Dow will be registered as a martial Islands dowo LLC which uh provides the dowo members liability protection it also gives the dowo corporate personhood so it can sign agreements own intellectual property or even hire employees which is extremely important the Dow we also have a council called the iccc council members will

09:10:57	have no power to act on behalf of the Dao but they are simply community members that were selected by the Dao to submit quality proposals for it to vote on council members are selected or fired and they are accountable to the Dao with protection to prevent them controlling too much influence over uh the voting power the general voting power and the final aspect which is a key document is the Dow's ICBC Constitution it is ratified as an official uh governing document it is onchain gives the Dao specific processes for handling certain

09:11:33	tasks such as hiring for example which um is extremely important how can you help now well if you believe in the decentralized future where communities can manage events I would totally suggest you to have a look at launch. ip- cc.com [Music] all right pcpcc we're back as I mentioned we're going to be going into a wrap-up session here soon but I just wanted to acknowledge that uh you know how incredible it's been that we've had over 10,000 viewers you know thank you all for contributing and spreading

09:12:13	awareness about pcpcc and we're you know so excited that you've all been here to join us and you know thank you to Cedric who made this all possible Cen State the last two years of the pcpcc have been truly a blessing for this ecosystem can't thank you enough and as we mentioned on the panel earlier Daniel and I even met in person at your first code and state event in New York or at least our first code and state event um and I can't thank you enough for you know getting that electric energy because it does help influence so many

09:12:45	builders on the IP or on internet computer protocol and getting people networking and built up all this great energy together it's seriously electric Cedric shout out to you this wrapup is going to be amazing so please direct your attention to Cedric right [Music] now wow and that's the end of pcpcc 2024 this is not only the first birthday of pcpcc but it's also the third anniversary of ICP the network went live in May 2021 and I am just am amazed how much we've built and created in those short 3 years so the only thing that's

09:13:28	left is to say a big thank you to a few people first and foremost eston Ricardo Isaac sep and the entire Cod and State team who have worked day and night for the last few months to make this possible thank you for all the entrepreneurs that took the courage to record a video or get up on stage and share what they've built and why they're building on DIC I know it's hard thank you so much for doing that and sharing your process with all of us of course big thank you to all the content creators that participated in today's

09:13:57	event and everything leading up to it without you we wouldn't have been able to spread the message as widely as we have and last but definitely not least thank you to all the Meetup organizers around the globe that have made it possible to not only meet online but also connect with fellow icps offline this is not the end this is just the beginning of yet another incredible year in the ICP ecosystem if you are an IC person if you've already been in this ecosystem you you now have this breath of videos that hopefully answer lots of

09:14:27	the questions that you often get asked when you're onboarding people that just learn about the IC so feel free to send them over to our catalog and share videos from there actively to show them how many cool things are being built on the IC and if you are new to the ICP ecosystem Welcome to our community it's great to have you and hopefully today we have not only sparked your curiosity but we've already passed some ideas and given you some insights into how ICP can enrich your life and what you are

09:14:56	building there's lots of people around you that are also passionate about the IC so use the remaining time to connect with them build friendships plant some seeds and hopefully we can all meet again in a year from now I'm incredibly excited what all of you are going to build in this coming year I wish you a great year lots of fun building and I can't wait to see you again in a year from now with that have a beautiful day stay curious and I'll talk to you soon [Music] all right ICP CC we are back and that
